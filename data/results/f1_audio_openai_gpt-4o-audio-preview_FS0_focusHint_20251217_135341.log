You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference.  You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because the focus is on "BILL." This means Sam did not give grapes to anyone else besides Bill. If Sam also gave Sue grapes, that contradicts S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because the focus is on "SUE." This means Sam did not give oranges to anyone else. If he also gave Rob oranges, that contradicts S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave grapes only to Sue and no one else. Since S2 says he didn't give Ellen grapes, this is consistent with S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
B  
Because the focus is on "apples." This means Sam gave Tom only apples, not any other fruit. S2 is independent because it talks about grapes, not apples.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the focus is on "oranges." This means Sam only gave Rob oranges and nothing else. If Sam also gave Rob apples, that contradicts S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on "SUE." This means Sam gave grapes only to Sue. The fact that he didn’t give grapes to Tom supports that interpretation.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the focus is on "ELLEN." This means Sam only gave bananas to Ellen and to no one else. If he also gave them to Mary, that contradicts S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because the focus is on "bananas." This means Sam only gave Rob bananas. The fact that he didn’t give Rob oranges is consistent with that (it supports the idea that he only got bananas).

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus is on "bananas." This means Sam gave Mary only bananas and nothing else. If he also gave Mary apples, that contradicts S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because the focus is on "SUE." This means Sam only gave oranges to Sue, so it’s consistent that he didn’t give Rob any oranges either.
