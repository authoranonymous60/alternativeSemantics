You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on “ELLEN” in S1, it means Sam didn’t give grapes to anyone else but Ellen. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on “ELLEN” in S1, it means Sam only gave apples to Ellen and not to anyone else. However, S2 contradicts S1 by stating that Sam didn’t give Ellen apples at all.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on “ROB” in S1, it means Sam gave grapes only to Rob and not to anyone else. S2 contradicts this by claiming Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on “ROB” in S1, it means Sam gave apples only to Rob and not to anyone else. S2 contradicts this by stating that Sam also gave Ellen apples.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on “ELLEN” in S1, it means Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else but Ellen. While S2 says Sam didn’t give Bill apples, which is compatible with S1, it doesn’t follow necessarily from it. Therefore, the two statements are independent.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on “ROB” in S1, it means Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else but Rob. While S2 says Sam didn’t give Sue apples, this is compatible but does not necessarily follow from S1, so they are independent.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on “ROB” in S1, it means Sam only gave something (oranges) to Rob, not to others. However, S1 says nothing about the type of item exclusively. S2 states that Sam also gave Rob apples. This statement is independent because S1 does not restrict what else was given to Rob besides oranges.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on “ROB” in S1, it means Sam gave apples to Rob and to no one else. However, S1 does not restrict what else was given to Rob in terms of types of items. S2 states Sam also gave Rob grapes, which does not contradict the focus on the recipient. Therefore, it does not contradict S1 regarding recipients. But the word “only” applied to apples suggests exclusivity with respect to apples among items to Rob. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1 by introducing another type of item besides apples.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on “ROB” in S1, it means Sam gave bananas only to Rob and not to anyone else. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas, and S2 follows from S1.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on “MARY” in S1, it means Sam gave apples only to Mary and not to anyone else. S2 contradicts this by stating Sam also gave Ellen apples.
