--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because S1 states that Bill was the only person who received grapes, but S2 states that Sue also received grapes, which contradicts S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because S1 states that Sue was the only person who received oranges, but S2 states that Rob also received oranges, which contradicts S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue grapes, it entails that he didn't give grapes to anyone else, including Ellen.

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
B  
Because S1 focuses on apples and doesn't mention grapes, so S2 is independent from S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because S1 indicates Rob only received oranges, but S2 states he also received apples, which contradicts S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue grapes, it means he didn’t give grapes to anyone else, including Tom.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because S1 indicates Ellen was the only one who received bananas, but S2 states Mary also received bananas, which contradicts S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob bananas, it entails he didn’t give him anything else, including oranges.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because S1 states that Mary only got bananas, but S2 says she also received apples, which contradicts S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue oranges, it means Rob didn’t get any oranges, which aligns with S2.
