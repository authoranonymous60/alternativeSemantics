You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Rob and no one else. Therefore, S2, which states that Sam didn't give Tom bananas, is entailed by S1, as it aligns with the interpretation that Rob was the exclusive recipient of bananas.

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM," meaning Sam only gave grapes to Tom and not grapes to others. However, this does not provide information about whether Sam gave Tom other fruits. Therefore, the statement that Sam didn’t give Tom oranges is independent of S1 because S1 does not address whether Tom received oranges or not.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "oranges," meaning Sam gave Sue only oranges and no other items. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave Sue apples. If Sue received only oranges, she could not have also received apples.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Sue and no one else. This does not necessarily entail anything about Rob, as it does not say whether Rob received bananas or not. Therefore, S2 is independent of S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "oranges," meaning Sam only gave oranges to Tom and nothing else. Therefore, S2 is entailed, since it logically follows that Sam did not give Tom bananas or any other fruit.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "apples," meaning Sam gave Sue only apples and no other items. Therefore, S2, which says Sam didn’t give Sue oranges, is entailed, as it logically follows that Sue did not receive any fruit besides apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "grapes," meaning Sam gave Sue only grapes and no other items. Therefore, S2 is entailed, as it logically follows that Sue did not receive apples or any other fruit.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam only gave oranges to Ellen and not oranges to anyone else. The introduction of bananas in S2 contradicts S1, which is why it cannot be entailed.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "grapes," meaning Sam gave Mary only grapes and no other items. Therefore, S2 is entailed, as it follows logically that Mary did not receive apples or any other fruit.

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam only gave oranges to Bill and not oranges to anyone else. This statement does not address whether Mary received oranges, so S2 is independent from S1.
