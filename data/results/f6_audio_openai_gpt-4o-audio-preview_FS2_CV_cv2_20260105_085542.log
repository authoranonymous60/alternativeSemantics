--- Attempt 1 for f6_cv2 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus on "ROB" in S1 means the apples were only given to Rob, not Sue or anyone else. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because S1 states that only grapes were given to Sue, meaning no oranges were given. S2 contradicts this by saying Sue got oranges as well.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue grapes, then no other fruit like bananas were given to her, so S2 is entailed by S1.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
B  
Because S1 limits grape-giving to Mary, but it doesn't say anything about Ellen in particular. The two statements are independent as S1 doesn’t cover Ellen’s case.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because S1 says Rob only received oranges, so S2 contradicts that by saying Rob also got bananas.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue bananas, no other fruit, like grapes, were given. This entails S2.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
A  
Because S1 says Tom only got grapes, so no apples or other fruits were given. S2 is entailed by S1.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Tom only got bananas, it means he didn't get grapes or any other fruit. S2 is entailed by S1.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because S1 says Rob only got apples, so S2 contradicts that by adding that Rob also got grapes.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because S1 states that only grapes were given to Ellen, meaning no oranges. S2 contradicts that by saying Ellen also got oranges.
