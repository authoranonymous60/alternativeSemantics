You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Your output must follow this structure:

S1: ...
S2: ...
A

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference.  You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Ellen." This means Sam did not give grapes to anyone besides Ellen. S2 says Sam gave Ellen oranges, which contradicts the focus interpretation that Ellen only got grapes.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Ellen." This means Sam did not give apples to anyone except Ellen. S2 talks about Rob receiving apples, which is unrelated and doesn't follow from the first sentence nor directly contradicts it. So they are independent.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Mary." This means Sam didn't give oranges to anyone except Mary. If Sam only gave Mary oranges, it naturally follows that he didn’t give her bananas. Thus S2 is entailed by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
C  
Because the focus is on "Mary," meaning no one else besides Mary got oranges. S2 contradicts that by saying Sam also gave oranges to Tom.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the focus is on "Mary." It means that no one other than Mary got oranges. Therefore, S2, which says Sam didn’t give oranges to Tom, follows naturally and is entailed.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus is on "Mary," meaning Mary only received grapes and nothing else. The second sentence says Mary also received apples, which contradicts the focus interpretation.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Sue." That means only Sue got apples, and no one else did. S2 contradicts this by saying Mary also got apples.

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because the focus is on "Bill," meaning only Bill received oranges and nothing else. S2 says Bill got bananas too, contradicting the exclusive nature of the first sentence.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus is on "Ellen," meaning Ellen only received bananas and nothing else. S2 contradicts that by stating Ellen also got grapes.

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Tom," meaning only Tom got bananas and not anything else. S2, which says Sam didn’t give Tom oranges, is consistent with and entailed by S1.
