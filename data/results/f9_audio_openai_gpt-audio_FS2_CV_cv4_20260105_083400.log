--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the word "only" in S1 places a restriction on what Sam gave Ellen—just bananas. But S2 says Sam gave Ellen grapes as well, which contradicts that restriction.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because S1 says Sam only gave Mary apples, which means no other fruit was given to Mary. S2 confirms this by saying Sam didn’t give Mary oranges. So S2 logically follows from S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because S1 restricts the gift to Tom as only bananas, while S2 claims Sam also gave Tom apples. This directly contradicts S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because if Mary only got apples, it follows that she didn’t get grapes. S2 confirms this absence, making it entailed by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary oranges, that means Mary didn’t get any apples. S2 states that fact explicitly, so it is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because S1 says only Rob got apples. S2 brings in Mary, saying she also got apples. This doesn’t confirm or contradict S1 directly; it’s about someone else. So they are independent.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave TOM apples.  
C  
Because S1 says that only Rob got apples—excluding everyone else. S2 says Tom also got apples, which contradicts the restriction imposed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, then by definition Sam didn’t give Rob bananas. S2 states that fact clearly, making it entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because S1 says only Bill got grapes, while S2 introduces Rob getting grapes. This adds new information not covered by S1. The statements are independent, as shown.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because S1 says Rob was only given grapes. S2 says Rob also got bananas, which contradicts S1’s restriction. This is the contradiction illustrated.
