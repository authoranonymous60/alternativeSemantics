--- Attempt 1 for f8_cv0 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning that Sam gave oranges only to Rob and not to anyone else. This entails that Sam didn't give Rob anything else (like apples). Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning that Sam gave bananas only to Bill and not to anyone else. Therefore, it follows that Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas, and S2 is entailed by S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Rob and no one else. If S2 says he also gave them to Sue, that contradicts S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning that Sam gave bananas only to Bill and not to anyone else. Therefore, it follows that Sam didn’t give Mary bananas, and S2 is entailed by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning that Sam gave grapes only to Ellen and not to anyone else. Therefore, it follows that Sam didn’t give Rob grapes, and S2 is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning that Sam gave oranges only to Rob and not to anyone else. If S2 says he also gave oranges to Sue, that contradicts S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning that Sam gave bananas only to Bill and not to anyone else. Therefore, it follows that Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas, and S2 is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning that Sam gave bananas only to Rob and not to anyone else. As a result, it follows that Sam didn’t give Mary bananas, so S2 is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning that Sam gave grapes only to Ellen and not to anyone else. Therefore, it follows that Sam didn’t give Rob grapes, and S2 is entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning that Sam gave bananas only to Bill and not to anyone else. Therefore, it follows that Sam didn’t give Mary bananas, and S2 is entailed by S1.
