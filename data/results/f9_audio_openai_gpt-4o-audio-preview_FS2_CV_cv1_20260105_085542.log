--- Attempt 1 for f9_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the first statement says Sam only gave Ellen bananas, and the second statement says Sam also gave Ellen grapes, which contradicts the exclusivity expressed in S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, it implies he didn't give her other fruits like oranges. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the first statement indicates Sam exclusively gave Tom bananas, and the second statement contradicts that by saying he also gave Tom apples.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, he didn’t give her any other fruits like grapes. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary oranges, he gave her no other fruits, so it is entailed that he didn't give her apples.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because S1 specifies what Sam gave Rob, while S2 talks about what Sam gave Mary. These statements are about different people, so they are independent.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave TOM apples.  
B  
Because S1 is about what Sam gave Rob, and S2 is about what Sam gave Tom. They concern different people, so the statements are independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, then he certainly didn't give him bananas. S2 is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because S1 is about what Bill received, and S2 is about what Rob received. These are independent statements as they concern different people.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because S1 specifies that Sam exclusively gave Rob grapes, meaning no other fruits were given. S2 contradicts this by stating that Sam also gave Rob bananas.
