You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave apples only to Sue and to no one else. S2 says Sam also gave Rob apples, which directly contradicts the meaning of S1.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave apples only to Bill and no one else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Mary apples, which is consistent with that meaning. If only Bill got apples, it follows that Mary did not.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave oranges only to Mary and no one else. S2 says Sam also gave Ellen oranges, which contradicts the meaning of S1.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave apples only to Ellen and no one else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Tom apples, which is consistent with that meaning. If only Ellen got apples, Tom did not.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Rob and no one else. S2 says Sam also gave Rob oranges, which contradicts that meaning. Sam was restricted to giving only bananas to Rob, so giving him oranges as well is a contradiction.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Bill and no one else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Bill grapes, which is consistent with that meaning. If Bill only got bananas, then he didn’t get grapes.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave oranges only to Ellen and no one else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes, which is consistent with that meaning. It follows that if she only got oranges, she didn’t get grapes.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Mary and no one else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas, which is independent. It neither contradicts nor follows from S1 since S1 doesn’t mention Ellen at all.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Bill and no one else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Tom bananas, which is consistent with that meaning. If Bill exclusively got bananas, Tom did not.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave oranges only to Sue and nothing else to Sue. S2 says Sam didn’t give Sue grapes, which is consistent with that meaning. If Sue only got oranges, she didn’t get grapes.
