You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.
C
Because S1 states that the only person who got grapes from Sam was Bill, while S2 introduces another recipient, Sue, contradicting the exclusivity asserted in S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.
C
Because S1 establishes that Sue is the sole recipient of oranges, and S2 contradicts that by saying Rob also received oranges, violating the exclusivity from S1.

2
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.
A
Because S1 implies that Sue is the only recipient of grapes, which aligns with S2’s statement confirming that Ellen did not receive grapes.

3
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
A
Because S1 asserts that apples were the only thing Tom received, and S2 is consistent with that by confirming that Tom didn’t get any grapes.

4
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.
C
Because S1 limits what Rob received to only oranges, whereas S2 contradicts that by adding apples as another item Rob received. 

5
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
A
Because S1 says Sue is the only recipient of grapes, and S2 supports that by confirming that Tom, in fact, got no grapes.

6
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
B
Because S1 says Ellen is the only recipient of bananas, and S2 introduces Mary as another recipient, which is independent and does not uphold or negate the exclusivity about Ellen receiving bananas. It adds new information.

7
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.
B
Because S1 is about bananas given exclusively to Rob, while S2 is about oranges not given to Rob. These statements are about different items and are independent.

8
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.
C
Because S1 states that bananas are the only thing Mary received, while S2 contradicts that by introducing apples as another received item.

9
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.
B
Because S1 limits the orange-giving to Sue alone, and S2 simply reports that Rob didn’t get any oranges. These statements do not overlap in a way that entails or contradicts—they operate independently.
