--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because "Sam only gave TOM apples" means that Tom is the only person who got apples, and it excludes Sam giving Tom something else. "Sam also gave Tom grapes" contradicts this by stating Tom received something other than apples.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because "Sam only gave MARY bananas" means Mary is the only person who got bananas, so it follows that Bill did not get bananas. This makes S2 entailed by S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because "Sam only gave MARY apples" means that the only thing Mary received from Sam was apples, excluding other items like bananas. The statement that Sam also gave her bananas contradicts this.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
A  
Because "Sam only gave SUE apples" means that Sue was the only person to receive apples, which implies that Rob did not get any apples. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because "Sam only gave BILL bananas" means that Bill got only bananas and not any other fruit. The statement that Sam also gave Bill grapes contradicts this.

5  
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
A  
Because "Sam only gave Rob GRAPES" means the only thing Rob received was grapes, and this excludes him receiving apples. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because "Sam only gave SUE grapes" means Sue was the only person who received grapes from Sam. The statement that Sam also gave Tom grapes contradicts this.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because "Sam only gave ELLEN grapes" means Ellen is the only one who got grapes, so this excludes Rob from receiving grapes. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because "Sam only gave MARY grapes" means Mary got only grapes and nothing else. Stating that Sam also gave Mary bananas contradicts this.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
A  
Because "Sam only gave SUE apples" means Sue was the only one who got apples, and this excludes Bill receiving apples. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.
