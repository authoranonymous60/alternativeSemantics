   C = contradicted.

--- Raw Model Output ---

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB bananas.  
C  
Because S1 specifies that only Ellen received bananas, but S2 says Rob also received bananas, which contradicts the exclusivity in S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB oranges.  
B  
Because S1 talks about grapes, but S2 brings up oranges, which is unrelated to the exclusivity of grapes.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave BILL apples.  
C  
Because S1 specifies Tom exclusively received apples, but S2 says Bill also received apples, contradicting the exclusivity in S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave MARY bananas.  
B  
Because S1 focuses on apples, but S2 introduces bananas, which is independent of the exclusivity statement about apples.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave SUE oranges.  
C  
Because S1 specifies that Ellen exclusively received oranges, but S2 says Sue also received oranges, contradicting S1’s claim.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ROB apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, then he didn’t give Rob apples, so S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ELLEN bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill bananas, then it’s implied he didn’t give Ellen any bananas, so S2 is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave SUE bananas.  
C  
Because S1 specifies that Rob exclusively received bananas, but S2 says Sue also received bananas, contradicting the exclusivity in S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give MARY bananas.  
A  
Because if Bill was the only one to receive bananas, Mary did not receive bananas, so S2 is entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ROB grapes.  
A  
Because if Ellen was the only one to receive grapes, then Rob did not receive grapes, so S2 is entailed by S1.
