You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave SUE BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.
A
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BANANAS," meaning that Sue received only bananas and nothing else. This entails that Sue did not receive grapes. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave TOM GRAPES.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "GRAPES," meaning Tom received only grapes and not any other items. This excludes apples or anything else. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

2
S1: Sam only gave TOM BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
A
Because in S1 the focus is on "BANANAS," meaning Tom received only bananas. This excludes grapes or any other items. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

3
S1: Sam only gave ROB APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "APPLES," meaning Rob received only apples and no other items. S2 contradicts this by stating that Rob also received grapes. So S2 is contradicted by S1.

4
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN GRAPES.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "GRAPES," meaning Ellen received only grapes and nothing else. S2 contradicts this by saying that Ellen also received oranges. Therefore, S2 is contradicted by S1.

5
S1: Sam only gave SUE APPLES.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue oranges.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "APPLES," meaning Sue received only apples and not oranges or anything else. S2 directly follows from that and is entailed by S1.

6
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN ORANGES.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen apples.
A
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," implying Ellen received only oranges. Thus, S2 is entailed as it states Ellen did not receive apples.

7
S1: Sam only gave MARY GRAPES.
S2: Sam didn't give Mary oranges.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "GRAPES," meaning Mary received only grapes and not oranges or any other items. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

8
S1: Sam only gave ROB BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "BANANAS," meaning Rob received only bananas and not apples or anything else. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

9
S1: Sam only gave TOM ORANGES.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Tom received only oranges. This entails that Tom did not receive grapes. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.
