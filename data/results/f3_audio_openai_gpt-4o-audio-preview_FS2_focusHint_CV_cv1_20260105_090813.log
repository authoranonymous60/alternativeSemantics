You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on Ellen, meaning Sam gave grapes to Ellen but not to anyone else. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam didn’t give grapes to Tom or any other person.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on apples, meaning Sam gave apples (and nothing else) to Ellen. S2 contradicts this entirely by saying Sam didn’t give Ellen apples, which opposes the assertion in S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on Rob, meaning Sam gave grapes only to Rob. However, S2 states that Sam gave grapes to Ellen as well, which introduces a contradiction to the exclusivity implied in S1. Yet, this scenario is more complex because it’s not directly contradictory but rather independent since both sentences can coexist by changing the focus of exclusivity.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on Rob, meaning Sam gave apples only to Rob. S2, by saying Sam also gave apples to Ellen, creates a situation that doesn’t directly contradict but rather stands independent since the exclusivity in S1 and the statement in S2 can only be resolved by focusing on the scope of "only."

4  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on Ellen, meaning Sam gave apples exclusively to Ellen and not to anyone else. Therefore, it is entailed that he didn’t give apples to Bill or any other person.

5  
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on Rob, meaning Sam gave apples exclusively to Rob and not anyone else. Therefore, it is entailed that he didn’t give apples to Sue.

6  
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on oranges, meaning Sam gave Rob only oranges and nothing else. The fact that S2 says Sam gave Rob apples seems independent since one focuses on oranges, while the other talks about apples, creating no direct contradiction but no entailment either.

7  
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on apples, meaning Sam gave Rob only apples and no other item. S2 says Sam also gave Rob grapes, which directly contradicts the exclusivity of the first statement.

8  
S1: Sam only gave Rob BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on Rob, meaning Sam gave bananas exclusively to Rob and no one else. Therefore, it is entailed that he didn’t give bananas to Ellen or any other person.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on Mary, meaning Sam gave apples only to Mary and no one else. S2 states Sam also gave Ellen apples, which directly contradicts the exclusivity asserted by S1.
