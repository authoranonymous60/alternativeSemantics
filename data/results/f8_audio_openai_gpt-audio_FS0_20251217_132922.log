You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Your output must follow this structure:

S1: ...
S2: ...

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

Understood. I’ll begin by transcribing and analyzing each pair. 

Let’s go through them one-by-one.

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB bananas.  
C  
Because S1 states that Ellen was the only recipient of bananas, but S2 claims that Rob also received bananas. This directly contradicts the focus on "ELLEN" in S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB oranges.  
B  
Because S1 states that grapes were the only thing given to Rob, and S2 introduces a new, unrelated event where Rob receives oranges. The two are independent actions.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave BILL apples.  
C  
Because S1 states that Tom was the only recipient of apples, but S2 claims that Bill also got apples. This contradicts the exclusivity of "TOM" in S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave MARY bananas.  
B  
Because S1 focuses on Mary as the only receiver of apples, and S2 introduces bananas—an entirely different item. The focus in S1 does not exclude Mary from receiving other items, so these statements are independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave SUE oranges.  
C  
Because S1 states that Ellen was the only recipient of oranges, while S2 claims that Sue also got oranges. This contradicts the exclusivity of "ELLEN" in S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ROB apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, it follows that Sam didn’t give Rob any other fruit, including apples. S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ELLEN bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill bananas, then by definition, Sam did not give bananas to anyone else, including Ellen. S2 is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave SUE bananas.  
C  
Because S1 states that Rob was the only recipient of bananas, but S2 claims that Sue also received bananas. This contradicts the exclusivity of "ROB" in S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give MARY bananas.  
A  
Because if Bill was the only recipient of bananas, it follows that Mary did not receive bananas. S2 is entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ROB grapes.  
A  
Because if Ellen was the only recipient of grapes, it follows that no one else, including Rob, received grapes. S2 is entailed by S1.
