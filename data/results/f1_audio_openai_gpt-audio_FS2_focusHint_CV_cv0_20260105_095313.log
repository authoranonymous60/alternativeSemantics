You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave grapes to Bill and no one else. S2 says Sam also gave Sue grapes, which contradicts the claim in S1.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave oranges to Sue and no one else. S2 states that Sam also gave Rob oranges, contradicting S1.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave grapes to Sue and no one else. S2 states Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes, which is entailed by S1, since S1 excludes anyone other than Sue from receiving grapes.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "apples," meaning Sam gave Tom apples and nothing else to Tom. S2 says Sam didn’t give Tom grapes, which is entailed by S1, as S1 implies that apples were the only thing given to Tom.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "oranges," meaning Sam gave Rob oranges and nothing else to Rob. S2 says Sam also gave Rob apples, which contradicts S1.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
B  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave grapes to Sue and no one else. S2 says that Sam didn’t give Tom grapes. This is independent of S1 because S1 makes no claim about whether anyone else (like Tom) received grapes; it only asserts Sue is the sole grape recipient.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave bananas to Ellen and no one else. S2 says Sam also gave Mary bananas, which contradicts S1.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "bananas," meaning Sam gave Rob bananas and nothing else to Rob. S2 says Sam didn’t give Rob oranges, which is entailed by S1, as S1 implies Rob received only bananas.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "bananas," meaning Sam gave Mary bananas and nothing else. S2 says Sam also gave Mary apples, which contradicts S1.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
B  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave oranges to Sue and no one else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Rob oranges. This is independent of S1 because S1 says nothing about Rob; it only talks about Sue being the sole orange recipient.
