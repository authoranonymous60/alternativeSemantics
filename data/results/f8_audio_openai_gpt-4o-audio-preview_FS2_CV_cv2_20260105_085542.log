--- Attempt 1 for f8_cv2 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because S1 means Ellen was the sole recipient of bananas, but S2 says Rob also received bananas, which contradicts S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because S1 means grapes were the only thing Sam gave Rob, but S2 says Rob also received oranges, which contradicts S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave Tom APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
B  
Because S1 restricts what Sam gave Tom to only apples but doesn’t restrict what was given to others like Bill, so S2 is independent.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because S1 means apples were the only thing Sam gave Mary, and S2 introduces bananas, which contradicts S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
B  
Because S1 restricts what Ellen received to oranges but doesn’t restrict what Sue received, so S2 is independent.

5  
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, it entails that Rob didn’t receive any apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
B  
Because S1 specifies what Bill received but says nothing about what Ellen received, so S2 is independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave Rob BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
B  
Because S1 restricts what Rob received but doesn’t restrict what Sue received, so S2 is independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary bananas.  
B  
Because S1 limits what Bill received but doesn’t say anything about Mary, so S2 is independent.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave grapes to Ellen, it follows that Rob didn’t get any grapes.
