You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.
C
Because focusing on BILL in S1 means Sam gave grapes to Bill and not to anyone else. S2 says Sam also gave Sue grapes, contradicting that exclusivity.

1
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.
C
Because focusing on SUE in S1 means Sam gave oranges to Sue and not anyone else. S2 says Sam also gave Rob oranges, which contradicts the exclusivity.

2
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.
A
Because focusing on SUE in S1 means that no one else besides Sue got grapes. S2 says Ellen didn’t get grapes, which is consistent with that exclusivity.

3
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
A
Because focusing on apples in S1 means that apples were the only thing Sam gave to Tom, and no other item like grapes. S2 says Sam didn’t give Tom grapes, consistent with that.

4
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.
C
Because focusing on ORANGES in S1 means oranges were the only thing Sam gave to Rob. S2 says Sam also gave apples to Rob, which contradicts that exclusivity.

5
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
A
Because focusing on SUE in S1 means that Sue was the only recipient of grapes. S2 says Sam didn’t give Tom grapes, which is consistent with that exclusivity.

6
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
C
Because focusing on ELLEN in S1 means that Ellen was the only recipient of bananas. S2 says Sam also gave Mary bananas, which contradicts that exclusivity.

7
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.
A
Because focusing on bananas in S1 means bananas were the only thing Sam gave Rob. S2 says Sam didn’t give Rob oranges, which is consistent with that exclusivity.

8
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.
C
Because focusing on bananas in S1 means that bananas were the only thing Sam gave to Mary. S2 says Sam also gave Mary apples, contradicting that exclusivity.

9
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.
A
Because focusing on SUE in S1 means Sue was the only recipient of oranges. S2 says Sam didn’t give Rob oranges, which is consistent with that exclusivity.
