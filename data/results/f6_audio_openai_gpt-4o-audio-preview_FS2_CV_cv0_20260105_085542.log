--- Attempt 1 for f6_cv0 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, it excludes giving apples to anyone else, including Sue.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Sue grapes, that means he didn't give her anything else, but the second sentence says he also gave her oranges, which contradicts the first sentence.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue grapes, that means he didn’t give her anything else, so he wouldn’t have given her bananas either.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary grapes, then he didn’t give grapes to anyone else, but the second sentence says he also gave grapes to Ellen, which contradicts the first sentence.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, that means he gave Rob no other fruit. The second sentence says he also gave Rob bananas, which contradicts the first sentence.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue bananas, it means he didn’t give her anything else, including grapes.

6  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom grapes, it means he didn’t give him any other fruits, including apples.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom bananas, he didn’t give him any other fruits, including grapes.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, it means he didn’t give him any other fruit, but the second sentence says he also gave Rob grapes, which contradicts the first sentence.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, it means he didn’t give her anything else, but the second sentence says he also gave her oranges, which contradicts that.
