--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the word "only" indicates exclusivity in S1, meaning Ellen did not receive oranges. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam gave Ellen oranges.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because S1 claims exclusive giving to Ellen, while S2 says apples were also given to Rob. This contradicts the exclusivity implied by “only.”

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary oranges, it logically follows that Mary didn’t receive bananas as well. S2 is entailed by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
C  
Because S1 implies exclusivity—that only Mary got oranges—but S2 states that Tom also received oranges, which contradicts the exclusivity.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because since oranges were only given to Mary, S1 entails that Tom did not get any oranges, which is exactly what S2 states.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because S1 says Sam exclusively gave Mary grapes, and S2 contradicts that by stating that she was also given apples. 

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because S1 means that Sue is the sole recipient of apples. S2 contradicts this by saying that Mary also received apples.

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because if Bill was exclusively given oranges as S1 states, then giving him bananas as well, per S2, would contradict this exclusivity.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because S1 indicates Ellen received only bananas and nothing else. S2 says she also got grapes, which contradicts the exclusivity.

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because if Tom only received bananas, then it follows naturally that he didn’t receive oranges. S2 is entailed by S1.
