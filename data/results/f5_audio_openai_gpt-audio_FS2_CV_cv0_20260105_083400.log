--- Attempt 1 for f5_cv0 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because "only gave Ellen GRAPES" means grapes were the sole thing given to Ellen, but S2 says oranges were also given, contradicting S1.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because "only gave ELLEN apples" means only Ellen received apples, but S2 says Rob also got apples, contradicting S1.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because "only gave MARY oranges" entails that oranges were the only thing given to Mary, so not giving Mary bananas fits this.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
B  
Because "only gave MARY oranges" restricts what Mary got, but it says nothing about what Tom received, so the two statements are independent.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because "only gave MARY oranges" is about what Mary got, and doesn't say if Tom got oranges, so these are independent.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because "only gave MARY GRAPES" means grapes were the only thing given to Mary, but S2 says Mary also got apples, contradicting S1.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because "only gave SUE apples" means Sue was the only receiver considered for apples in S1, but S2 refers to Mary getting apples, so they’re independent.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because "only gave BILL oranges" means Bill only got oranges, but S2 says Bill also got bananas, contradicting S1.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because "only gave ELLEN bananas" means bananas were the only thing Ellen got, but S2 says grapes were also given to Ellen, contradicting S1.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because "only gave TOM BANANAS" means Tom didn’t get anything else, so not giving Tom oranges is entailed.
