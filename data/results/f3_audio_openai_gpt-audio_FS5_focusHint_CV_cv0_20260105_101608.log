--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Ellen," meaning Sam gave grapes only to Ellen and no one else. Therefore, it follows that Sam did not give grapes to Tom.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "apples," meaning Sam gave only apples to Ellen and nothing else. Therefore, it follows that Sam did not give Ellen oranges.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "grapes," meaning Sam gave Rob only grapes and nothing else. It does not exclude the possibility that Sam gave grapes to others, such as Ellen. Therefore, S2 is independent.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "apples," meaning Sam gave Rob only apples and nothing else. It does not exclude the possibility that Sam gave apples to others, such as Ellen. Therefore, S2 is independent.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "apples," meaning Sam gave Ellen only apples and nothing else. It does not exclude or entail whether Sam gave apples to other people like Bill. Therefore, S2 is independent.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Rob," meaning Sam gave apples only to Rob and no one else. Therefore, it follows that Sam did not give apples to Sue.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Rob," meaning Sam gave oranges only to Rob and no one else. This does not, however, restrict the item given. S2 states that Sam gave Rob another item (apples), which contradicts the notion that oranges were the only item given to Rob.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Rob," meaning Sam gave apples only to Rob and not to anyone else. S2 says Sam gave Rob grapes too, which contradicts the idea that apples were the only thing Rob received.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Rob," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Rob and no one else. Therefore, it follows that Sam did not give bananas to Ellen.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Mary," meaning Sam gave apples only to Mary and no one else. S2 states that Sam also gave apples to Ellen, which directly contradicts S1.
