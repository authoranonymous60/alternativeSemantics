--- Attempt 1 for f4_cv4 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because S1 says Sue is the only one who got apples, but S2 says Rob also got apples, which contradicts S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because S1 says Bill is the only one who got apples, which means no one else, including Mary, got apples. S2 states that Mary didn’t get apples, which follows from S1, so it’s entailed.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because S1 says Mary is the only one who got oranges, and S2 says Ellen also got oranges, which contradicts S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.  
A  
Because S1 says Ellen is the only one who got apples, which means Tom didn’t get apples. S2 confirms that Tom didn’t get apples, so it’s entailed.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
B  
Because S1 is about bananas and says Rob is the only one who got bananas. S2 talks about oranges. There’s no direct logical connection between who got bananas and who got oranges, so these statements are independent.

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because S1 says Bill is the only one who got bananas, implying that he didn’t get anything else like grapes. S2 says Bill didn’t get grapes, which aligns with that and is entailed.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because S1 says Ellen is the only one who got oranges, which means she didn’t get grapes. S2 states she didn’t get grapes, which fits with S1, so it’s entailed.

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because S1 says Mary is the only one who got bananas, which means Ellen didn’t get bananas. S2 says Ellen didn’t get bananas, so it’s entailed.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because if Bill is the only one who received bananas, that means no one else, including Tom, received bananas. Thus, S2 follows directly from S1 and is entailed.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because S1 says Sue is the only one who got oranges, implying she didn’t get any other fruit, including grapes. S2 says Sue didn’t get grapes, which follows from S1, so it’s entailed.
