You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave bananas to Bill and no one else. S2 contradicts this by claiming Sam also gave another thing (grapes) to Bill. The contradiction arises because the meaning of the "only" sentence focuses on the recipient, not on the items given. Therefore, giving Bill something else contradicts the exclusivity implied by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave ELLEN apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave apples to Mary and no one else. S2 claims Sam also gave apples to Ellen, which directly contradicts the exclusivity implied in S1. So the two statements are in contradiction.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave TOM apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning that Sam gave apples to Sue and no one else. S2 states that Tom also received apples. This contradicts the exclusivity in S1, creating a contradiction between the sentences.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave grapes to Bill and no one else. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Bill oranges, which aligns with the idea that grapes were the only thing given to Bill. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL." It means that Sam gave apples to Bill and no one else. Therefore, Sam did not give Bill bananas or anything else. S2 is consistent with this and is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning that Sue only received apples from Sam and no other item. S2 says that Sue didn’t get bananas, which aligns perfectly with the exclusivity indicated by "only." Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give TOM oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave oranges to Ellen and to no one else. S2 says that Sam didn’t give Tom oranges, which is consistent with the exclusivity of recipients. This is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give MARY apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM," meaning that Tom was the only person who received apples from Sam. Therefore, S2, which states that Mary didn’t get apples, follows logically and is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave BILL apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM," meaning that Tom was the only person who received apples. S2 claims that Bill also received apples, which contradicts the exclusivity of the recipient in S1. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give TOM bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning that she was the only person who received bananas from Sam. S2, which says that Tom didn’t get bananas, aligns perfectly with the exclusivity condition of S1. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.
