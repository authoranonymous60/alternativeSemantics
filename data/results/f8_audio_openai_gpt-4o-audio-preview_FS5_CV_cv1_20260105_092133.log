--- Attempt 1 for f8_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, then giving Rob oranges contradicts that statement.

2

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, then giving Mary bananas contradicts that statement.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.

C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob bananas, then giving bananas to Sue contradicts that statement.

8
