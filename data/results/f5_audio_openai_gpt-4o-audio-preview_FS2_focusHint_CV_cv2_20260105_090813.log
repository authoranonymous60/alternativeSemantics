You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning that Sam did not give the grapes to anyone else. S2 contradicts this idea indirectly, because if Sam gave Ellen additional fruits, this potentially violates the exclusive focus on Ellen receiving only grapes.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Ellen was the only person who received those apples. S2 contradicts this by introducing Rob as another recipient of apples, directly violating the exclusivity implied by "only."

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning oranges were the only thing given to Mary. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Mary bananas, which is consistent and fully entailed by the statement that Sam only gave her oranges.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning that oranges were the only item given to Mary. Nothing is said about other people, so the fact that Sam also gave oranges to Tom is independent of the focus in S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning that oranges were the only item given to Mary and nothing is mentioned about others. The information about giving or not giving oranges to Tom is independent of that focus.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "GRAPES," meaning Mary received only grapes and nothing else. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave Mary apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave MARY apples.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sue was the only person who received apples. The fact that Sam also gave Mary apples is independent of the focus on Sue.

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "oranges," meaning Bill only received oranges and nothing else. S2 contradicts this by saying Bill also received bananas.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "bananas," meaning Ellen received only bananas and nothing else. S2 contradicts this by stating that Sam also gave her grapes.

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "bananas," meaning that bananas were the only thing Tom received. S2 confirms this by saying Sam didn’t give Tom oranges, which is entailed by the statement in S1.
