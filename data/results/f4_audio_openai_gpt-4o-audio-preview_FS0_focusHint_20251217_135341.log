You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference.  You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the focus is on "SUE", it means Sam did not give anyone else apples. The statement that Sam also gave Rob apples contradicts this.

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the focus is on "BILL", it means Sam did not give apples to anyone else besides Bill. Therefore, it’s entailed that Mary didn’t get any apples.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the focus is on "MARY", it means Sam did not give oranges to anyone else. Therefore, the second sentence contradicts the first.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.  
A  
Because the focus is on "ELLEN", it means Sam did not give apples to anyone else. Therefore, it’s entailed that Tom didn’t get any apples.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
B  
Because the focus is on "ROB" and "bananas", it only restricts the claim to the type of fruit he gave Rob. It says nothing about other fruits, so giving Rob oranges is independent.

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on "BILL" and "bananas", it means Sam didn’t give anything else to Bill. Therefore, this entails that Bill didn’t get grapes.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on "ELLEN" and "oranges", it means Sam didn’t give Ellen any other fruit. Therefore, it’s entailed that Ellen didn’t get grapes.

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
B  
Because the focus is on "MARY" and "bananas", it says nothing about Ellen. The information about Ellen is independent of the first sentence.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on "BILL" and "bananas", it means Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else. Therefore, the fact that Tom didn’t get bananas is entailed.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on "SUE" and "oranges", it means Sam didn’t give Sue any other fruit. Therefore, it’s entailed that Sue didn’t get grapes.
