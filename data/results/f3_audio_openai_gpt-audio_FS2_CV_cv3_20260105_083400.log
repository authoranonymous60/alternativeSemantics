--- Attempt 1 for f3_cv3 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, it directly entails that Sam didn’t give grapes to anyone else, including Tom.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen apples, it means he did give her apples. S2 directly contradicts that by saying he didn’t give her apples.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, that means no one else received grapes. S2 contradicts this by saying Ellen also received grapes.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, it means he did not give apples to anyone else. S2 contradicts this by saying Ellen also got apples.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen apples, that entails that no one else received apples, including Bill. Therefore, S2 is entailed.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, it entails that no one else, including Sue, received apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the first statement talks about oranges, and the second talks about apples. There is no contradiction or entailment. They are independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the first statement talks about apples, and the second introduces grapes. There is no direct contradiction or entailment. They are independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob bananas, it entails that he didn’t give bananas to anyone else, including Ellen.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, it means no one else got apples. S2 contradicts that by saying Ellen also got apples.
