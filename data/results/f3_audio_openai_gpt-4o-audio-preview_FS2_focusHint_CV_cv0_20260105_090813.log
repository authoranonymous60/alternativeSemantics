You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, it means Ellen was the only person who received grapes. Consequently, Tom did not receive any grapes. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen apples, it means that apples are the only thing he gave her, so he didn’t give her oranges or anything else. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, then no one else, including Ellen, received grapes. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, it means Rob was the only recipient of apples. The claim that he also gave apples to Ellen contradicts that.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen apples, it means no one else, including Bill, received apples. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, it means that Rob was the only person to receive apples. Therefore, Sam didn't give apples to Sue or anyone else. S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the focus on "oranges" means that oranges were the only thing Sam gave to Rob. This does not entail anything about whether Sam gave Rob apples or not, so S2 is independent of S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the focus on "apples" means that apples are the only thing Sam gave to Rob. This does not speak about whether he also gave Rob grapes or something else. S2 is independent of S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob bananas, it means no one else got bananas, which entails that Ellen didn’t get bananas. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, then no one else, including Ellen, received apples. So the statement that he also gave Ellen apples contradicts the first sentence.
