You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave Tom APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.
C
Because if Sam only gave Tom apples, that means he did not give Tom anything else. S2 states that Sam also gave Tom grapes, which contradicts the focus on apples in S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave Mary BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.
B
Because S1 focuses on Mary receiving only bananas. S2 is about Bill and does not relate to Mary or her receiving bananas. Therefore, S2 is independent of S1.

2
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
C
Because S1 states that Mary received only apples. This means she did not receive anything else. S2 says she also received bananas, which directly contradicts S1.

3
S1: Sam only gave Sue APPLES.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.
B
Because S1 focuses on Sue receiving only apples. S2 discusses Rob and whether he received apples or not. That information about Rob is independent of the statement about Sue.

4
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.
C
Because S1 says Bill received only bananas, implying Bill did not receive anything else. S2 states that Bill also received grapes, which contradicts S1.

5
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.
A
Because S1 says that Rob only received grapes, meaning Rob did not receive any other items. S2 says Rob didn’t get apples, which is consistent with S1 and thus entailed.

6
S1: Sam only gave Sue GRAPES.
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.
B
Because S1 focuses solely on Sue and what she received. It does not say anything about what Tom received. S2’s statement about Tom is independent of S1.

7
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.
B
Because S1 is specifically about Ellen receiving only grapes. S2 talks about Rob and whether Rob received grapes or not. These two sentences are independent.

8
S1: Sam only gave Mary GRAPES.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
C
Because S1 states that Mary received only grapes, implying no other items were given to her. S2 says she also received bananas, which contradicts S1.

9
S1: Sam only gave Sue APPLES.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.
B
Because S1 says that Sue received only apples. It does not state anything about Bill. S2 is about what Bill did or did not receive, so S2 is independent of S1.
