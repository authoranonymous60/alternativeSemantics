You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave Ellen BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BANANAS." This means Sam did not give Ellen anything other than bananas. There is no claim about whether Sam gave bananas to someone else, so the new information in S2 (that Sam also gave Rob bananas) is independent—it doesn’t contradict or follow from S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB." This means Sam did not give anyone other than Rob grapes. There is no claim restricting what Sam might have given Rob other than grapes. Therefore, S2 (that Sam gave Rob oranges) is independent of S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM." This means Sam did not give anyone else but Tom apples. S2 states that Sam also gave Bill apples, which contradicts the claim that no one else got apples.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY." This means Sam did not give apples to anyone other than Mary. There is no restriction on giving other items, like bananas, to Mary. Thus, S2 is independent of S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES." This means Sam did not give Ellen anything other than oranges. There is no claim about whether Sam gave oranges to others, so S2 (saying Sam gave Sue oranges) is independent.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB." This means Sam did not give oranges to anyone other than Rob. It does not say anything about what else Rob received. S2 (that Rob didn’t get apples) does not contradict or add any independent facts. It is entailed, because S1 doesn’t specify any non-orange gift to Rob, and in fact, it is consistent with S1 that Rob didn’t get apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL." This means no one else but Bill got bananas. S2 (saying Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas) follows from S1. Therefore, it’s entailed.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB." This means no one other than Rob got bananas. S2 (that Sue also got bananas) contradicts this statement, so it’s a contradiction.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL." This means no one else but Bill got bananas. S2 (that Mary didn’t get bananas) is entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN." This means no one else but Ellen got grapes. S2 (that Rob didn’t get grapes) is directly entailed.
