--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.
A
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, then he did not give Rob anything else, including apples. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.
B
Because S1 is about what Sam gave to Sue, while S2 discusses what Sam gave to Tom. These two sentences discuss different recipients, so they are independent.

2
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.
B
Because S1 is about Ellen, and what Sam gave her, while S2 is about Rob. There is no direct link between these two pieces of information. They are independent.

3
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
C
Because S1 says the only thing Sam gave to Mary was grapes, while S2 states that Sam also gave Mary bananas. This contradicts S1.

4
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.
B
Because S1 is about what Sam gave to Sue. S2 is about Bill and what he did not receive. These are independent statements about different individuals.

5
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.
A
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, then he did not give Rob anything else, including oranges. S2 logically follows from S1.

6
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.
C
Because S1 says the only thing Sam gave Tom was apples. S2 says Sam also gave Tom grapes, which contradicts S1.

7
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.
C
Because S1 says the only thing Sam gave Bill was bananas. S2 says Sam also gave Bill grapes, contradicting S1.

8
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
A
Because if Sam only gave Mary bananas, then saying that he also gave her bananas does not add anything contradictory. It is consistent and can be inferred from S1.

9
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.
B
Because S1 is about Sue and the apples given to her. S2 is about Bill and what he didn't receive. These are independent statements, as they refer to different individuals.
