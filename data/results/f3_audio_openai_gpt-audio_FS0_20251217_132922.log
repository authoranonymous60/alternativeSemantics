You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Understood. I will now process the input audio for each index.

Let's begin. Please provide the audio samples for S1 and S2. Once provided, I’ll transcribe both statements, mark prosodic focus in S1 using uppercase, and then classify the relationship of S2 to S1 with an explanation. You may proceed with the audio.

Understood. I'll transcribe and analyze each pair of sentences (S1 and S2) from the audio, mark prosodic focus in S1 using uppercase, and classify S2 relative to S1 as entailed (A), independent (B), or contradicted (C), and provide a reason for that classification.

Understood. I will proceed with the transcription and classification.

Let’s start processing each item step by step.

0
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.
S2: Sam didn’t give TOM grapes.
B
Because S2 talks about a different person (Tom) from S1 (Ellen). The statements are independent, as S1 only specifies what was given to Ellen, not anyone else.

1
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN APPLES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.
C
Because S2 directly contradicts the content of S1. S1 says Sam gave Ellen apples, while S2 says Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.

2
S1: Sam only gave ROB GRAPES.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
C
Because S1 says grapes were only given to Rob, but S2 says they were also given to Ellen, which contradicts the exclusivity suggested by “only.”

3
S1: Sam only gave ROB APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.
C
Because S1 states that only Rob got apples, whereas S2 claims Ellen also got apples, contradicting S1’s exclusivity.

4
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN APPLES.
S2: Sam didn’t give BILL apples.
A
Because if Sam only gave apples to Ellen, then it logically follows that Sam didn’t give apples to Bill. S2 is entailed by S1.

5
S1: Sam only gave ROB APPLES.
S2: Sam didn’t give SUE apples.
A
Because if Sam only gave apples to Rob, then S2 follows logically. Sue wasn’t on the receiving end of apples. So S2 is entailed by S1.

6
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.
B
Because the type of fruit in S2 (apples) is different from the type of fruit in S1 (oranges). The statements are independent, focusing on different sets of items given to Rob.

7
S1: Sam only gave ROB APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.
C
Because S1 says Rob only got apples, and S2 says Rob also got grapes. This contradicts the exclusivity stated in S1.

8
S1: Sam only gave ROB BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn’t give ELLEN bananas.
A
Because if Rob was the only person who received bananas, it follows that Ellen didn’t receive any. S2 is entailed by S1.

9
S1: Sam only gave MARY APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.
C
Because S1 says only Mary received apples, while S2 says Ellen also received apples. This contradicts the exclusivity expressed in S1.
