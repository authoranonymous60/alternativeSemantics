You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on ROB, meaning Sam gave bananas only to Rob and no one else. Therefore, it entails that Sam didn’t give bananas to Tom or anyone else.

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on TOM, meaning Sam gave grapes only to Tom, and no other item to Tom. This means it entails that Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on SUE, meaning Sam gave oranges to Sue and didn’t give oranges to anyone else. It does not rule out giving Sue other things. But S2 states Sam also gave Sue apples, which contradicts the typical implication of exclusivity under the assumption that “only” might extend to the item in typical use.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on SUE, meaning Sam gave bananas only to Sue and not to anyone else. Therefore, it entails that Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.

4  
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on ORANGES, meaning that Sam gave Tom only oranges and nothing else. Therefore, it entails that Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue oranges.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on SUE, meaning Sam gave apples only to Sue and did not give apples to anyone else. This doesn’t entail anything about what else Sue did or didn’t receive, making S2 independent.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on GRAPES, meaning Sam gave Sue only grapes and nothing else. Therefore, it entails that Sam didn’t give Sue apples.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on ORANGES, meaning Sam gave Ellen only oranges and nothing else. S2 says Sam also gave Ellen bananas, which directly contradicts that.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on GRAPES, meaning Sam gave Mary only grapes and nothing else. Therefore, it entails that Sam didn’t give Mary apples.

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on BILL, meaning Sam gave oranges only to Bill and not to anyone else. S2 states that Sam also gave Mary oranges, which is independent from the claim about Bill and doesn’t follow from or contradict S1 directly. It’s about another person entirely, making it independent.
