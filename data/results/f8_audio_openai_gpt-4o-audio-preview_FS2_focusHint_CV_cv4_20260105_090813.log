You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because focusing on "bananas" means Sam did not give anything else to Ellen. However, the second sentence says Sam also gave Rob bananas, which contradicts the exclusivity implied by "only" in focusing on what Sam gave Ellen.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because focusing on "grapes" means Sam did not give anything else to Rob. However, the second sentence says Sam also gave Rob oranges, which contradicts the exclusivity implied by "only" in focusing on the item given to Rob.

2  
S1: Sam only gave Tom APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
B  
Because focusing on "apples" means Sam didn't give Tom anything else aside from apples. The second sentence states someone else, Bill, also received apples, but it does not contradict or entail anything specific about what Tom received. The statements are independent.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because focusing on "apples" means Sam did not give Mary anything else. The second sentence says Sam also gave Mary bananas, which contradicts the exclusivity implied by "only".

4  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
B  
Because focusing on "oranges" means Sam didn't give Ellen anything else besides oranges. The second sentence says someone else, Sue, also got oranges, but it is independent of the exclusivity concerning Ellen.

5  
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
A  
Because focusing on "oranges" means Sam gave Rob nothing else besides oranges. The second sentence that says Rob didn't receive apples is directly entailed by the first sentence.

6  
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
B  
Because focusing on "bananas" means Sam only gave Bill bananas and nothing else. The statement about not giving Ellen bananas is independent since it does not relate to what Bill received.

7  
S1: Sam only gave Rob BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
B  
Because focusing on "bananas" means Sam didn't give Rob anything else besides bananas. The fact that Sue also received bananas is independent of what Rob received.

8  
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
B  
Because focusing on "bananas" means Sam only gave Bill bananas and nothing else. The statement about Mary not receiving bananas is unrelated to what Bill received.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.  
B  
Because focusing on "grapes" means Sam didn’t give Ellen anything else but grapes. The statement about Rob not receiving grapes is independent of what Ellen received.
