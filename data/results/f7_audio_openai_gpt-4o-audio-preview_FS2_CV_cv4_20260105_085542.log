--- Attempt 1 for f7_cv4 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave Tom APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.
B
Because...

9
S1: Sam only gave Sue BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because S1 says Bill only received bananas, but S2 says Bill also received grapes, which contradicts the exclusivity implied by the word "only."

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because S1 says Mary was the only one who received apples, but S2 says Ellen also received apples, contradicting that exclusivity.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because S1 says Sue was the only person who got apples, but S2 says Tom also got apples, which contradicts the exclusivity.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because S1 states Bill exclusively got grapes, and S2 is consistent with that by saying Bill didn’t get any other fruit like oranges.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because if Bill only got apples (S1), then it’s logically entailed that he didn’t get bananas, as confirmed by S2.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because S1 says Sue only got apples. That means no bananas were given to her, so S2 follows logically.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because S1 talks about what was only given to Ellen, but S2 talks about what was not given to Tom, which is a separate statement that doesn’t contradict or confirm S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because S1 says only Tom received apples, which entails that no one else, including Mary, received apples. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because S1 says only Tom got apples, but S2 contradicts that by stating Bill got apples too.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because if Sue was the only one who got bananas (S1), then it follows that Tom didn’t get any, so S2 matches that.
