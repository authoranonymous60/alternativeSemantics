You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

--- Raw Model Output ---

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB apples.  
C  
Because S1 says Sam only gave apples to Sue, implying that no one else received apples. S2 contradicts this by saying Rob also received apples.

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give MARY apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Bill, it must be true that Mary didn't get any.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave ELLEN oranges.  
C  
Because S1 claims Mary is the only one who got oranges, but S2 contradicts this by saying Ellen also got oranges.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give TOM apples.  
A  
Because if Ellen is the only one who got apples, then Tom would not have received any apples.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB oranges.  
B  
Because S1 talks about bananas, and S2 talks about oranges, they don't contradict each other, and S2 does not entail or support S1 in any way. They are independent facts.

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give BILL grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill bananas, then it follows logically that Bill did not receive grapes.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ELLEN grapes.  
A  
Because if Ellen only got oranges, it follows naturally that she didn’t get any grapes.

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ELLEN bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary bananas, it implies that no one else, including Ellen, got bananas.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give TOM bananas.  
A  
Because if Bill is the only one who got bananas, then Tom must not have received any.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give SUE grapes.  
A  
Because if Sue only got oranges, then naturally she didn’t get grapes.
