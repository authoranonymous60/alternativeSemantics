--- Attempt 1 for f4_cv2 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because S1 asserts that Sue is the only person who received apples, but S2 introduces Rob as another recipient of apples, contradicting S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
A  
Because S2 repeats the fact that Rob received apples, which is consistent with S1's assertion that Rob (and only Rob) received apples.

2  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because S1 states that Bill was the only recipient of apples, and S2 that Mary did not receive any apples is consistent with that.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because S1 says that only Mary received oranges, but S2 claims that Ellen also received oranges, which contradicts S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
A  
Because S1 says that Ellen was the sole recipient of apples, so it naturally follows that Tom didn't receive apples, which is consistent.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
B  
Because S1 limits the distribution of bananas to Rob, and S2 talks about oranges, a different fruit, so the two statements are about different facts and are independent.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because if Bill only received bananas, as S1 states, then it follows that he did not receive grapes, which aligns with S2.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because S1 says Ellen only got oranges, and S2 stating that Ellen did not receive grapes is in line with that, as oranges were the only thing given.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because S1 asserts that Mary was the only recipient of bananas, so logically, no one else, like Ellen, received bananas, making S2 consistent.

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because S1 states Bill was the only one to get bananas, which means Tom did not receive any bananas, perfectly aligning with S2.
