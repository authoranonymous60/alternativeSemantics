You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on ELLEN. This means Sam gave grapes only to Ellen and not to anyone else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Tom grapes. This is consistent with the focus, and nothing in S2 contradicts or goes beyond S1’s claim. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on ELLEN. This means Sam gave apples only to Ellen and not to anyone else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Ellen apples, which directly contradicts S1. Therefore, S2 is contradicted by S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on ROB. This means Sam gave grapes only to Rob and not to anyone else. S2 says Sam also gave Ellen grapes, which directly contradicts the claim in S1. Thus, S2 is contradicted by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on ROB. This means Sam gave apples only to Rob and no one else. S2 says Sam also gave Ellen apples, which contradicts S1. Therefore, S2 is contradicted by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on ELLEN. This means Sam gave apples only to Ellen and not to anyone else. S2 states Sam didn’t give Bill apples, which is consistent with the claim in S1. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on ROB. This means Sam gave apples only to Rob and no one else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Sue apples, which fits with the meaning of S1. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on ROB. This means Sam gave oranges only to Rob, but it makes no claim about what else (other items) Sam might have given to Rob. S2 says Sam also gave Rob apples, which introduces a different item. This is independent of S1. Therefore, S2 is independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on ROB. This means Sam gave apples only to Rob and not to anyone else. S2 states that Sam also gave Rob grapes, which introduces another item. This does not contradict or follow from the original claim but is independent of it. Thus, S2 is independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on ROB. This means Sam gave bananas only to Rob and not to anyone else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas, which is consistent with S1’s meaning. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on MARY. This means Sam gave apples only to Mary and not to anyone else. S2 says Sam also gave Ellen apples, which contradicts the core claim of S1. Thus, S2 is contradicted by S1.
