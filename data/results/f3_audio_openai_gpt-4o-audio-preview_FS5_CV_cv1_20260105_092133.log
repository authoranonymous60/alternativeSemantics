--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, that means no one else besides Ellen got grapes, which includes Tom. So, this entails that Tom didn't receive grapes.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen apples, it means she did get apples and no one else did. The second statement that says Sam didn’t give Ellen apples contradicts that.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, then giving grapes to Ellen directly contradicts that idea. The second statement contradicts the exclusivity specified in the first.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if the focus is on Rob only receiving apples, no one else should have received apples. The second statement directly contradicts that by stating that Ellen also got apples.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Ellen, that naturally means he didn’t give apples to anyone else, including Bill. The second statement is entailed by the first. 

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Rob, then Sue did not get apples. The second statement follows logically from the first.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the first statement only restricts the distribution of oranges to Rob but doesn't limit other kinds of fruit. The second statement that Sam also gave Rob apples is independent of the first.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the first statement only restricts apples to Rob, but doesn’t say anything about whether Rob got other fruits. So, giving grapes to Rob is independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave bananas to Rob, that means he didn’t give bananas to anyone else, including Ellen. The second statement is entailed by the first.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Mary, no one else should have received apples. The second statement claims that Ellen also got apples, which contradicts the first.
