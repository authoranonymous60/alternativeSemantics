You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because the first sentence states that Sam only gave grapes to Bill, which excludes giving grapes to anyone else. The second sentence says Sam also gave grapes to Sue, directly contradicting the exclusivity in S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because S1 specifies Sue as the only recipient of oranges, while S2 contradicts this exclusivity by saying Rob received oranges as well.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because S1 states that Sue was the only recipient of grapes. This implies no one else, including Ellen, received grapes. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes, which is consistent with that implication.

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
B  
Because S1 focuses on apples and limits their recipient to Tom. S2 is about grapes and states that Tom did not receive grapes. These sentences refer to different foods and are independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because S1 limits Rob’s gifts only to oranges, while S2 states Rob also got apples. This contradicts the restriction established in S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because S1 says Sue was the only person to receive grapes, which means no one else, including Tom, received grapes. S2 confirms this by saying Tom didn’t get grapes.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because S1 limits the bananas only to Ellen, but S2 says that Mary also got bananas. This contradicts the exclusivity stated in S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because S1 states that Rob was exclusively given bananas, which implies he wasn’t given anything else. S2 confirms that Rob didn’t get oranges, aligning with that inference.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because S1 restricts Mary’s gift to bananas only. But S2 says Mary also got apples, contradicting that exclusivity.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because S1 states that Sue was the only recipient of oranges. This means Rob didn’t get any oranges. S2 aligns with that, confirming that Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.
