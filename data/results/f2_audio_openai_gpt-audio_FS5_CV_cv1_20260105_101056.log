You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
B  
Because the sentence focuses on “ROB” receiving bananas, and S2 talks about Tom. The two sentences mention different recipients.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus on “TOM” and the exclusivity means Sam gave Tom grapes and nothing else. Therefore, it follows that Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because the focus on “oranges” means Sam gave Sue only oranges, and yet S2 states Sam also gave Sue apples, which contradicts it.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
B  
Because S1 focuses on Sue receiving bananas, and says nothing about Rob. S2 independently talks about Rob not receiving bananas.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the focus on “oranges” means Tom only received oranges, so it logically follows that Tom didn’t get bananas.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because the focus on “apples” shows that Sue only got apples, so Sue didn’t receive other items such as oranges.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave Sue GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus on “GRAPES” means Sue got only grapes, so she didn’t get apples.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because the focus on “ELLEN” receiving only oranges is contradicted by S2, which says Ellen also got bananas.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
B  
Because the focus on “grapes” restricts what Mary got, and S2 says Mary didn’t get apples, which is consistent but not inferred directly, making them independent.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
C  
Because the focus on “BILL” receiving only oranges contradicts S2, which introduces a second person, Mary, also receiving oranges, breaking the exclusivity.
