--- Attempt 1 for f1_cv0 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
B  
Because "Sam only gave SUE grapes" means Sue is the only person to whom Sam gave grapes, and it says nothing about giving grapes to Tom. Therefore, S2 is independent of S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because "Sam only gave ELLEN bananas" means Ellen is the only person Sam gave bananas to. If Sam also gave Mary bananas, that contradicts the statement.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.  
B  
Because "Sam only gave ROB bananas" means Rob is the only person Sam gave bananas to, but it says nothing about whether or not Sam gave Rob oranges. Therefore, S2 is independent of S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because "Sam only gave MARY bananas" means that bananas were the only thing Sam gave to Mary. If Sam also gave her apples, that contradicts the statement.

4  
S1: Sam only gave SUE ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because "Sam only gave SUE ORANGES" means that Sue is the only person who received oranges, so it follows that Rob did not receive oranges. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because "Sam only gave BILL grapes" means that Bill is the only person who received grapes. If Sam also gave Sue grapes, that contradicts the statement.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because "Sam only gave SUE oranges" means Sue is the only person who received oranges. If Sam also gave Rob oranges, that contradicts the statement.

7  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because "Sam only gave SUE grapes" means Sue was the only person to whom Sam gave grapes. Therefore, it follows that Sam did not give Ellen grapes.

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
B  
Because "Sam only gave TOM apples" means Tom only received apples, but it doesn't mention grapes. S2 talks about grapes, which is not covered by S1, so S2 is independent of S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because "Sam only gave ROB oranges" means that oranges were the only thing Sam gave to Rob. If Sam also gave Rob apples, that contradicts the statement.
