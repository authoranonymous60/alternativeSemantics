0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
B  
Because the first sentence mentions only bananas, while the second sentence adds another fruit, making the statements independent.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, it implies he didn't give her any other fruit, including oranges.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the first sentence says Tom only got bananas, but the second says he also got apples, which contradicts the first.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, that means he didn't give her any other fruits, including grapes.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary oranges, it implies he didn't give her apples or any other fruit.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because the first sentence is about what Rob received, while the second sentence is about what Mary received, so they are independent.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
B  
Because the first sentence is about Rob and apples, while the second sentence introduces a different person (Tom) receiving apples, making these statements independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, that means he didn't give him any other fruits, including bananas.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the first sentence talks about what Bill received, while the second sentence talks about Rob, so they are independent.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the first sentence states that Rob only received grapes, but the second sentence says that Rob received bananas as well, which contradicts the first.
