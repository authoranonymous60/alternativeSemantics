You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

--- Raw Model Output ---

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave SUE apples, that excludes giving apples to Rob—so S2 contradicts S1.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave BILL apples, then giving apples to anyone else, including Mary, is excluded, so this follows logically.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave ELLEN oranges.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave MARY oranges, then giving oranges to someone else (Ellen) is excluded, so S2 contradicts S1.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave ELLEN apples, then he didn’t give apples to anyone else, including Tom, so S2 is entailed.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB oranges.  
B  
Because S1 restricts giving bananas only to Rob but doesn’t say anything about oranges. So S2 introduces new information that’s not ruled out by S1—it’s independent.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give BILL grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave BILL bananas, then he didn’t give him any other fruit, including grapes—so S2 follows directly.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ELLEN grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave ELLEN oranges, that rules out giving her grapes or any other fruit—so S2 is entailed.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ELLEN bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave MARY bananas, that excludes giving bananas to anyone else, including Ellen—so S2 is entailed.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give TOM bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave BILL bananas, giving bananas to anyone else, including Tom, is excluded—so S2 is entailed.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give SUE grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave SUE oranges, then he didn’t give her any other fruit, including grapes—so S2 is entailed.
