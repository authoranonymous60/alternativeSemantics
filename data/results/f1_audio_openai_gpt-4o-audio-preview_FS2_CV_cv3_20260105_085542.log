--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Bill grapes, he could not have also given Sue grapes. This contradicts the assertion of exclusivity.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Sue oranges, that means no one else received oranges. If he also gave Rob oranges, this contradicts that exclusivity.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue grapes, that implies no one else, including Ellen, received grapes. The second sentence affirms that no grapes were given to Ellen, so it follows from the first.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom apples, that rules out other fruits, including grapes. The second sentence supports this by asserting that Tom didn't receive grapes, so it is entailed by the first.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, then Rob didn’t receive any other kind of fruit. The second sentence contradicts that by stating Rob also received apples.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue grapes, then no one else, including Tom, received grapes. The second sentence stating that Tom didn't get grapes is entailed by the exclusivity in the first sentence.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen bananas, then no one else received bananas. The second sentence contradicts that by saying Mary also received bananas.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob bananas, that means Rob didn’t receive any other fruit, including oranges. The second sentence is consistent with this, so it is entailed.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary bananas, then she didn’t get any other fruit. The second sentence contradicts this by saying she also received apples.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue oranges, that means no one else, including Rob, received oranges. This is consistent with the second sentence, making it entailed.
