You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus on “TOM” in S1 means Sam did not give apples to anyone else but Tom. However, S2 says Sam gave Tom another kind of fruit (grapes), which does not contradict the focus of S1. But since “only” in S1 restricts the recipient, if the statement shifts to giving grapes as well, it does not explicitly affect the entailment about the specific recipient for apples. The contradiction arises in the sense that S1 suggests exclusivity that’s now challenged by another gift, creating indirect contradiction about exclusivity.

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because the focus on “TOM” in S1 means that Sam gave oranges to Tom and no one else. Therefore, it entails that Sam did not give oranges to Bill or anyone else, making S2 an entailment.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because the focus on “MARY” in S1 indicates that Sam gave bananas only to Mary and no one else. This naturally entails that Bill did not receive bananas.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the focus on “MARY” in S1 means Sam gave apples only to Mary and no one else. However, S2 says Sam gave Mary another type of fruit (bananas), which contradicts the exclusivity implied by S1 (that Mary only received apples and nothing else).

4  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the focus on “SUE” in S1 means that Sam gave apples to Sue and no one else. This entails that Rob didn’t get apples, which aligns with S2.

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because the focus on “BILL” in S1 means that Sam only gave bananas to Bill, and no one else got bananas. However, S2 says Sam also gave Bill grapes, which contradicts the exclusivity that Bill only received bananas.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the focus on “ROB” in S1 means Sam gave grapes only to Rob. This entails that Rob did not receive any other fruit, including apples, making S2 consistent with S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because the focus on “SUE” in S1 means that Sam gave grapes only to Sue and no one else. If Sam also gave grapes to Tom, that contradicts the exclusivity implied by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because the focus on “ELLEN” in S1 means that Sam gave grapes only to Ellen and no one else. Therefore, the statement that Rob didn’t get grapes is consistent with the entailment from S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the focus on “MARY” in S1 means that Sam gave grapes only to Mary and no one else. If S2 states that Mary also got bananas, this contradicts the exclusivity of what Mary was given in S1.
