You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on “ROB,” meaning Sam gave apples to only Rob and no one else. This entails that Sue did not receive apples.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on “SUE” and the meaning of the sentence is that Sue is the only one Sam gave grapes to. But S2 says Sam also gave Sue oranges, which contradicts the earlier exclusivity.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on “SUE,” meaning Sue is the only recipient of the grapes. This implies Sam didn’t give her bananas, so S2 is entailed.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on “MARY,” meaning Mary is the only person who received grapes. If S2 states Sam also gave Ellen grapes, that directly contradicts the exclusivity in S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on “ROB” receiving only oranges. If S2 says he also got bananas, that contradicts the exclusivity of S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because focusing on “BANANAS” means those are the only fruit Sue got. This entails that Sue didn’t get grapes.

6  
S1: Sam only gave TOM GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.  
A  
Because focusing on “GRAPES” means that Tom only got grapes, and no other fruit. This means he didn’t get apples either.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because focusing on “TOM” receiving only bananas means he didn’t get grapes, which entails S2.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because focusing on “APPLES” means Rob only got apples. If S2 says he also got grapes, that contradicts the exclusivity.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because focusing on “ELLEN” means she only got grapes. If S2 says she also got oranges, that contradicts S1.
