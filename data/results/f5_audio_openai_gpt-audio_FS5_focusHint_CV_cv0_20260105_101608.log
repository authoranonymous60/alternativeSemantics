You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave Mary GRAPES.
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.
C
Because if the focus is on GRAPES in S1, it means Sam didn’t give Mary anything other than grapes. S2 says that Sam also gave Mary apples, which contradicts S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.
B
Because the focus in S1 is on SUE, meaning Sam did not give apples to anyone except Sue. S2 introduces Mary as another recipient, independent from the assertion about Sue.

2
S1: Sam only gave BILL ORANGES.
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.
C
Because the focus is on ORANGES in S1, meaning Sam didn’t give anything else to Bill. S2 says that Sam also gave Bill bananas, contradicting that restriction.

3
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
C
Because the focus on ELLEN means that Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else but Ellen. However, S2 says that Sam gave Ellen another type of fruit—grapes—contradicting the idea that she only received bananas.

4
S1: Sam only gave TOM BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.
A
Because the focus is on BANANAS, meaning Tom didn’t receive anything but bananas. S2 states that Tom didn’t receive oranges, which aligns with the idea that bananas were the only thing he got.

5
S1: Sam only gave MARY GRAPES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.
A
Because the focus on GRAPES in S1 means Mary didn’t receive anything else from Sam. S2 confirms that Sam didn’t give Mary apples, which aligns with the entailment.

6
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.
B
Because the focus on BILL in S1 means that Bill was the only one who received grapes. S2 introduces Sue as also receiving grapes, which is independent of the claim about Bill.

7
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.
C
Because the focus is on ORANGES in S1, meaning Tom didn’t receive anything else. S2 states that Tom also received apples, which contradicts that.

8
S1: Sam only gave SUE APPLES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue oranges.
A
Because the focus on APPLES means Sue received no other fruit. S2 confirms that Sue didn’t receive oranges, so it’s consistent and entailed.

9
S1: Sam only gave MARY BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary grapes.
A
Because the focus on BANANAS means Mary didn’t receive anything else. S2 confirms that Mary didn’t receive grapes, so it aligns fully with the entailment.
