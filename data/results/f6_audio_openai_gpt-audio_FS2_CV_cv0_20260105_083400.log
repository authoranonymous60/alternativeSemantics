--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," and it excludes others like Sue. S2 aligns with this exclusion by stating Sam didn’t give apples to Sue, making it entailed.

1
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," and it restricts what she received to grapes only. S2 contradicts this by claiming that Sue also got oranges.

2
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE" receiving grapes and only grapes. S2 is entailed since it confirms that Sue didn’t get bananas, which matches the exclusivity implied by S1.

3
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
B
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY" and restricts grapes to Mary only. S2 introduces Ellen, a different individual receiving grapes, which is independent from the limitation of S1. It doesn’t pertain to Mary, so it’s not entailed or contradicted.

4
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB" and that he only received oranges, excluding other items. S2 contradicts this by saying Rob also got bananas.

5
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE" receiving only bananas. S2 is entailed, as it aligns with the exclusivity by stating Sue didn’t get grapes.

6
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM" receiving only grapes. S2 is entailed since it confirms Tom didn’t get apples, consistent with the exclusivity.

7
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM" receiving only bananas. S2 is entailed as it confirms Tom didn’t get grapes.

8
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB" receiving only apples. S2 contradicts by adding that Rob also got grapes.

9
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN" and that she only got grapes. S2 contradicts this by saying Ellen also got oranges.
