--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, then that excludes the possibility of him giving grapes to Tom. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen apples, it means he did give Ellen apples. S2 states the opposite, that Sam didn’t give Ellen apples. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, that means he gave grapes to no one else. S2 says he also gave grapes to Ellen, which contradicts S1.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, that excludes giving apples to anyone else. S2 says he also gave apples to Ellen, which contradicts S1.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Ellen, that rules out giving apples to anyone else, including Bill. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, that means no apples were given to anyone else, so he didn’t give Sue apples. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because S1 says Sam only gave Rob oranges—it focuses on oranges. S2 talks about apples, which is another type of fruit and isn’t ruled out by S1. Thus, they relate to different aspects, making S2 independent of S1.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because S1 focuses on apples. S1 says Sam only gave Rob apples, meaning apples were not given to anyone else. But S2 mentions grapes, which is a different item, and S1 says nothing about grapes. Therefore, S2 is independent of S1.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob bananas, that excludes giving bananas to anyone else, including Ellen. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, that excludes giving apples to anyone else. S2 says he also gave apples to Ellen, which contradicts S1.
