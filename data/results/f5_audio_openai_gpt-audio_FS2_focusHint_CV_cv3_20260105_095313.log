You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because in S1, the focus is on Ellen. It means Sam gave grapes to Ellen and no one else received grapes. S2 states that Ellen also received oranges. This contradicts S1’s implication that grapes were the only thing given to Ellen.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because in S1, the focus is on Ellen. It means Sam gave apples only to Ellen and no one else got apples. S2 says Rob also got apples, which contradicts the focus-based inference from S1.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because in S1, the focus is on Mary. It means Sam gave oranges only to Mary and no other fruit was given to Mary. S2 says Sam didn’t give Mary bananas, which fits with the inference from S1 that Mary only got oranges.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
C  
Because in S1, the focus is on Mary. It means oranges were given only to Mary and not to anyone else. S2 says Tom also got oranges, which contradicts the inference from S1.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because in S1, the focus is on Mary. It means oranges were given only to Mary and not to anyone else. S2 says that Tom didn’t get oranges, which fits with the inference from S1.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because in S1, the focus is on the object: grapes. It means Mary only got grapes, nothing else. S2 says Mary also got apples, which contradicts the inference from S1.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because in S1, the focus is on Sue. It means apples were given only to Sue and no one else got apples. S2 says Mary also got apples, which contradicts the inference from S1.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave Bill ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because in S1, the focus is on the object: oranges. It means Bill only got oranges and no other fruit. S2 says Bill also got bananas, which contradicts the inference from S1.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because in S1, the focus is on Ellen. It means bananas were given only to Ellen and no one else got bananas. S2 says Ellen also got grapes, which adds another item given to Ellen and contradicts the inference from S1.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because in S1, the focus is on Tom. It means bananas were given to Tom and no one else got bananas. It doesn’t say anything about what other fruits might be involved, only that no one else got bananas. S2 says Tom didn’t get oranges, which does not contradict and is consistent with the inference from S1.
