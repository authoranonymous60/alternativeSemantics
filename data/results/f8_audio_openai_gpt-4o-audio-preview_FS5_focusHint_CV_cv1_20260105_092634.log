--- Attempt 1 for f8_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because focusing on "Ellen" means Sam gave bananas only to Ellen and not to anyone else. The second statement says Sam also gave bananas to Rob, which contradicts this.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
B  
Because focusing on "Rob" means Sam only gave something to Rob, but it does not say that the only thing he gave was grapes. The second statement about oranges is therefore independent, as it talks about a different item, not contradicting the focus on just whom he gave it to.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "Tom" means Sam did not give apples to anyone else. The second statement says Sam also gave apples to Bill, which contradicts this.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
B  
Because the focus is on "Mary," meaning Sam gave something only to Mary, but it's not about the type of fruit. It doesn’t prevent him from giving Mary other fruits. The second statement about bananas is independent of the first.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because focusing on "Ellen" means Sam only gave oranges to Ellen and no one else. The second statement says he also gave oranges to Sue, which contradicts this.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
A  
Because focusing on "oranges" means Sam only gave oranges to Rob and nothing else. The second statement that Sam didn’t give apples to Rob is entailed, as it aligns perfectly with the meaning of S1.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
B  
Because focusing on "bananas" means Sam only gave bananas to Bill and not to anyone else. The second statement that Sam did not give Ellen bananas does not follow directly and its truth is independent from the first statement.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave Rob BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
B  
Because focusing on "bananas" means Sam only gave bananas to Rob and not any other items. The second statement about Sue also getting bananas is independent, since it talks about someone else receiving bananas and does not contradict or entail what is said about Rob.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
B  
Because focusing on "bananas" means Sam gave bananas only to Bill, not to anyone else. The second statement about Mary not receiving bananas is independent. It does not follow directly from the first sentence and also does not contradict it directly.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.  
B  
Because focusing on "grapes" means Sam gave only grapes to Ellen. The fact that he didn’t give Rob grapes is independent, as S1 doesn’t say anything specifically about who else received grapes, just specifying what Ellen got.
