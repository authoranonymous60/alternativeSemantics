--- Attempt 1 for f6_cv0 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus is on Rob receiving the apples. Saying that Sam only gave Rob apples means that no one else, including Sue, received apples. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on Sue receiving bananas. Saying that Sam only gave Sue bananas means that he did not give her anything else, including grapes. So S2 is entailed by S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
A  
Because the focus is on Tom receiving grapes. Saying that Sam only gave Tom grapes means that no other item, including apples, was given to Tom. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on Tom receiving bananas. By saying that Sam only gave Tom bananas, it implies he didn’t give him anything else, including grapes. Hence S2 is entailed by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the focus is on Rob receiving apples. Saying that Sam only gave Rob apples means Rob did not get anything else. S2 contradicts S1 by stating Rob also received grapes, making both statements incompatible.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the focus is on Ellen receiving grapes. By stating that Sam only gave Ellen grapes, it means she received nothing else. S2 contradicts this by saying Ellen also got oranges, which can’t be true if S1 is true.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on Sue receiving oranges. Saying that Sam only gave Sue oranges means she didn’t receive any other item, including bananas. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus is on Mary receiving oranges. If Sam only gave Mary oranges, it means she received nothing else. S2 contradicts this by saying Mary also got apples, so it's a contradiction.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the focus is on Rob receiving oranges. Saying Sam only gave Rob oranges means Rob didn’t receive any other item, including apples. So S2 is entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
C  
Because the focus is on Tom receiving apples. If Sam only gave Tom apples, it means Tom received no other items. S2 contradicts S1 by stating that Tom also got oranges, hence it is contradictory.
