You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.
B
Because...

9

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else but Rob. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam didn’t give Tom (or anyone else) bananas.

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM," meaning Sam didn’t give grapes to anyone else but Tom. It implies there's no statement about oranges at all, just that it’s exclusively grapes for Tom. So, it's consistent/entailed that Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam gave Sue only oranges and nothing else. If S2 says Sam also gave her apples, that contradicts the claim in S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else but Sue. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam didn’t give bananas to Rob.

4  
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam didn’t give anything else but oranges to Tom. Thus, it’s entailed that Sam didn’t give Tom bananas, as that would contradict the exclusive focus in S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "APPLES," meaning Sam didn’t give anything else but apples to Sue. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam didn’t give Sue oranges.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "GRAPES," meaning Sam didn’t give anything else but grapes to Sue. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam didn’t give Sue apples.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam didn’t give anything else but oranges to Ellen. If S2 says Sam also gave her bananas, that directly contradicts the statement in S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "GRAPES," meaning Sam didn’t give anything else but grapes to Mary. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam didn’t give Mary apples.

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam didn’t give oranges to anyone else but Bill. If S2 says Sam also gave Mary oranges, that contradicts the exclusive interpretation from S1.
