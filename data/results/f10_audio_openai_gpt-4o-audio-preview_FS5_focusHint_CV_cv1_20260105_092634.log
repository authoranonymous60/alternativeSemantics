--- Attempt 1 for f10_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because the focus is on "Tom," meaning that Sam only gave apples to Tom and no one else received apples. The second statement contradicts this because if Sam also gave Tom grapes, then Tom received something more than just apples, contradicting the exclusivity of "only gave Tom apples."

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on "Mary," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Mary and no one else. This entails that Sam did not give bananas to Bill or anyone else, so S2 is entailed by S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the focus is on "Mary," meaning Sam only gave apples to Mary and nothing else to her. The second statement contradicts this by claiming Sam also gave Mary bananas, which breaks the exclusivity.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the focus is on "Sue." This means Sue was the only person to whom Sam gave apples, and therefore Sam did not give apples to Rob or anyone else. So S2 is entailed by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because the focus is on "Bill," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Bill and no other items to him. The second statement contradicts this, as it says Sam also gave Bill grapes, which means Bill received more than just bananas. That contradicts the exclusivity indicated by "only."
