You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because the focus is on "BILL" in S1 (Sam only gave BILL grapes), which means Sam did not give grapes to anyone else. S2 says Sam also gave grapes to Sue, which contradicts S1.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because the focus is on "SUE" in S1 (Sam only gave SUE oranges), which means Sam did not give oranges to anyone other than Sue. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam gave Rob oranges too.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on "SUE" in S1 (Sam only gave SUE grapes), which means Sam did not give grapes to anyone else. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes, which is fully consistent with S1.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on "TOM" in S1 (Sam only gave TOM apples), which means Tom didn’t get anything else from Sam. S2 says Sam didn’t give Tom grapes, which is entailed by S1.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the focus is on "ORANGES" in S1 (Sam only gave ROB ORANGES), which means Rob didn’t get anything else from Sam. S2 contradicts this by saying Rob also got apples.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on "SUE" in S1 (Sam only gave SUE grapes), meaning Sam did not give grapes to anyone else. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Tom grapes, which aligns with the entailment of S1.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
B  
Because the focus is on "ELLEN" in S1 (Sam only gave ELLEN bananas), meaning Ellen was the only recipient of bananas. S2 says Sam also gave Mary bananas, which is independent because it adds new information that is not entailed or strictly contradicted by S1 in the absence of a direct comparison to Ellen.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
B  
Because the focus is on "ROB" in S1 (Sam only gave ROB bananas), meaning no one else got bananas from Sam. S2 says Sam didn’t give Rob oranges, which doesn’t follow or contradict that statement—it's independent.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus is on "BANANAS" in S1 (Sam only gave MARY BANANAS), meaning Mary didn’t get anything else from Sam. S2 states that Mary also got apples, which directly contradicts S1.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
B  
Because the focus is on "ORANGES" in S1 (Sam only gave SUE ORANGES), meaning Sue was the only recipient of oranges. S2 says Sam didn’t give Rob oranges. This information is independent, as it doesn’t follow directly and is not contradicted by S1.
