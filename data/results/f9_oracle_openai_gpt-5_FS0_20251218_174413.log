0
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
B
Because S1 says Ellen is the only person who got bananas; it doesn’t restrict other fruits Ellen might get.

1
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Mary oranges.
B
Because S1 restricts recipients of apples (only Mary), not what Mary may receive; it doesn’t rule out or entail oranges.

2
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.
B
Because S1 restricts recipients of bananas (only Tom), not what Tom may also receive.

3
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.

Because S1 limits who got apples (only Mary), not whether Mary got grapes.

4
S1: Sam only gave Mary ORANGES.

Because S1 says the only thing Sam gave Mary was oranges, so he didn’t give her apples.

Because S1 limits what Rob received (only apples), not whether others also got apples.

A
Because S1 says the only thing Sam gave Rob was oranges, so he didn’t give him bananas.
