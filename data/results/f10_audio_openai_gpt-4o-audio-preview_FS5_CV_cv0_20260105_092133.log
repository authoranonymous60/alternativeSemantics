You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the focus "ROB" indicates that grapes were given only to Rob, which entails that Rob did not receive apples.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because the focus "SUE" means only Sue received grapes, so giving grapes to Tom would contradict that statement.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.  
B  
Because focusing on "ELLEN" means only Ellen got grapes, but this does not entail or contradict whether Rob was given grapes (it is independent information).

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
B  
Because focusing on "MARY" for grapes does not say anything about whether she also received bananas, so the two statements are independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
A  
Because focusing on "SUE" for apples means only Sue got apples, so Bill did not get apples. This entails the second statement.

5  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because focusing on "TOM" for apples means that apples were only given to Tom and therefore saying he also got grapes contradicts that restrictive condition.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because focusing on "BILL" for bananas means Bill only got bananas, so he did not get grapes, which entails the second statement.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "ELLEN" for apples means only Ellen got apples, so saying Rob also got apples contradicts that.

8  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom bananas.  
C  
Because focusing on "SUE" for bananas means only Sue got bananas, so giving bananas to Tom contradicts that.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill grapes.  
B  
Because focusing on "MARY" for grapes tells us that only Mary received grapes, but it does not say anything about Bill, making the two statements independent.
