--- Attempt 1 for f8_cv3 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen bananas, then he couldn’t have given Rob bananas. The statements contradict each other.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, then he couldn’t have also given Rob oranges. The second sentence contradicts the first.

2  
S1: Sam only gave Tom APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Tom apples, then he wouldn’t have given apples to Bill. That contradicts the first sentence.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, he couldn’t have given her bananas. The sentences contradict each other.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
B  
Because one sentence talks about Ellen and the other talks about Sue. They involve different people, so they are independent statements.

5  
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, it entails that he didn’t give Rob apples or anything else. The second sentence is entailed by the first.

6  
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill bananas, then he didn’t give bananas to Ellen. The second sentence is entailed by the first.

7  
S1: Sam only gave Rob BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
B  
Because the first sentence is about what Rob received, and the second is about Sue. They don’t directly contradict or entail each other, making them independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill bananas, then he didn’t give bananas to Mary or anyone else except Bill. The second sentence follows from the first.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, then he couldn’t have given grapes to Rob. The second sentence is entailed by the first.
