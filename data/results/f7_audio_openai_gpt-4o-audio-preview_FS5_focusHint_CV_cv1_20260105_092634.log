--- Attempt 1 for f7_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because focusing on "BILL" means Sam did not give bananas to anyone else, but it does not exclude giving something else to Bill. S2 contradicts S1 by stating that Bill received something other than bananas.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "MARY" means Sam did not give apples to anyone else except Mary. S2 contradicts S1 by saying that Ellen also received apples.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "SUE" means that only Sue got apples and no one else did. S2 contradicts S1 by saying that Tom also got apples.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because focusing on "grapes" means that Bill only got grapes and nothing else from Sam. Therefore, S2, which states that Sam didn't give Bill oranges, is entailed.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because focusing on "apples" means that Bill only got apples and no other items from Sam. So S2, which states that Sam didn’t give Bill bananas, is entailed.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because focusing on "apples" means Sue only got apples and nothing else. This entails that Sue didn’t get bananas, making S2 entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because focusing on "ELLEN" means that only Ellen got oranges, and no one else did. As a result, Tom could not have received oranges, so S2 is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because focusing on "TOM" means only Tom received apples, so Mary could not have received apples. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave Tom APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "APPLES" means Tom only got apples, but that doesn't restrict who else got apples. However, the presence of "only" in S1 implies exclusivity to Tom regarding apples, so S2 contradicts S1 by adding another recipient of apples.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Sue BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because focusing on "BANANAS" means that Sue was the only one who received bananas, so Tom could not have received bananas. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.
