0
S1: Sam only gave Bill bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.
C
Because “only gave Bill bananas” means the only thing Sam gave Bill was bananas, so he could not also have given Bill grapes.

1
S1: Sam only gave Mary apples.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.
B
Because S1 restricts what Mary received (only apples), not who else received apples; giving Ellen apples is compatible.

2
S1: Sam only gave Sue apples.
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.
B
Because S1 restricts what Sue received (only apples), not who else received apples; giving Tom apples is compatible.

3
S1: Sam only gave Bill grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill oranges.
A
Because if Bill got only grapes, then he didn’t get oranges.

S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.
A
Because if Bill got only apples, then he didn’t get bananas.

5
S1: Sam only gave Sue apples.

A
Because if Sue got only apples, then she didn’t get bananas.

6
S1: Sam only gave Ellen oranges.

Because S1 restricts what Tom received, not whether Mary got apples.

8
S1: Sam only gave Tom apples.
