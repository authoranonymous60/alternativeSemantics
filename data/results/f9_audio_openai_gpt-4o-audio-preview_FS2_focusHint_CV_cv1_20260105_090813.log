You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen bananas, it means he did not give her anything else. The statement that he also gave her grapes contradicts this.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, it entails that he didn’t give her any other fruit, including oranges. So, the second statement logically follows from the first.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Tom bananas, it means he gave him no other fruit. The second statement contradicts the first by saying he also gave Tom apples.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, that means he did not give her other fruits, including grapes. The second statement is entailed by the first.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary oranges, that means he didn't give her any other fruit, including apples. The second statement logically follows from the first.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, it focuses on the recipient (Rob). The second statement, which talks about giving apples to Mary, is independent. It doesn't contradict or entail the first.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
B  
Because focusing on Rob as the only recipient of apples doesn't tell us about anyone else like Tom. The second statement is independent because it speaks about another person and doesn’t contradict or derive from the first.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, it means he did not give Rob any other fruit, including bananas. The second statement is entailed by the first.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Bill grapes, then he didn’t give anyone else grapes. The second statement directly contradicts that by saying he also gave grapes to Rob.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, that means he didn’t give Rob any other fruit. The second statement says he also gave Rob bananas, which contradicts the first statement.
