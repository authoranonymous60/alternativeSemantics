You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Your output must follow this structure:

--- Raw Model Output ---

Understood. I will now proceed according to the instructions you provided, transcribing the utterances, marking the prosodic focus in S1 with uppercase, and classifying S2 relative to S1. Here’s the structured output:

0  
S1: SAM only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave BILL grapes.  
C  
Because S1 says Sam only gave Bill bananas, which excludes that he gave Bill grapes. So S2 directly contradicts S1.

1  
S1: SAM only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
B  
Because the subject and object pairs are completely different. S1 is about Sam and Bill with bananas, and S2 is about Sam and Mary with apples, so they are independent.

2  
S1: SAM only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave ELLEN apples.  
B  
Because S1 only restricts what Sam gave to Bill, but it says nothing about what Sam gave to Ellen, so S1 and S2 do not affect each other and are independent.

3  
S1: SAM only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave TOM apples.  
C  
Because S1 claims only Sue got apples from Sam, which excludes that Tom was also given apples, so S2 contradicts S1.

4  
S1: SAM only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give BILL oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill grapes, that means Sam did not give Bill any other fruit, including oranges, which means S2 is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: SAM only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give BILL bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill apples, then Sam did not give Bill bananas, so S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: SAM only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give SUE bananas.  
A  
Because according to S1, Sue only received apples from Sam, which means Sue did not receive bananas, so S2 is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: SAM only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give TOM oranges.  
B  
Because S1 only refers to what was given to Ellen. It does not mention what Sam gave or didn’t give to Tom, so S2 is independent of S1.

8  
S1: SAM only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give MARY apples.  
B  
Because S1 restricts Sam’s giving of apples to Tom only, but says nothing directly about Mary. While it might suggest Mary didn’t get apples, it’s not stated explicitly in S1, so S2 is independent.

9  
S1: SAM only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave BILL apples.  
C  
Because S1 says Tom is the only person who received apples from Sam, which excludes Bill getting apples as well. Thus, S2 contradicts S1.
