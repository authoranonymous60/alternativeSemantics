You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus on "ROB" in S1 means that Sam did not give apples to anyone else besides Rob, which entails that Sam didn’t give Sue apples.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus on "SUE" in S1 means that Sam only gave grapes to Sue and did not give grapes to anyone else. S2 talks about giving oranges, which is unrelated to the restriction in S1, so the statements are independent.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because the focus on “SUE” in S1 means that Sam only gave grapes to Sue and didn’t give anyone else grapes. Since S1 doesn’t specify that Sue got anything other than grapes, S2 (saying Sam didn’t give Sue bananas) is consistent and entailed by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because with the focus on "MARY," S1 means that only Mary received grapes, and no one else did. S2 contradicts this by stating that Ellen also received grapes.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
B  
Because the focus on "ROB" in S1 means that only Rob received oranges (and no one else got oranges). This doesn’t restrict what else Rob might receive, so S2, about bananas, is independent and not contradictory or entailed.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the focus on "SUE" means that only Sue got bananas and no one else got bananas. It also implies that Sue didn’t get anything else besides bananas, so S2 (that Sue didn't get grapes) is entailed.

6  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
A  
Because the focus on "TOM" means that Sam only gave grapes to Tom and didn’t give anyone else grapes. As a result, it follows that Tom did not get apples, so S2 is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus on "TOM" means that only Tom received bananas, and it implies that Tom didn’t receive anything else (like grapes). Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because with the focus on "ROB," S1 means that only Rob got apples, and no one else got apples. It also implies that Rob only got apples and nothing else. S2 contradicts this by saying Rob also got grapes.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because if the focus is on "ELLEN," it means that only Ellen received grapes, and no one else received grapes. It also implies that Ellen only received grapes and nothing else, so S2 (saying Ellen also got oranges) contradicts S1.
