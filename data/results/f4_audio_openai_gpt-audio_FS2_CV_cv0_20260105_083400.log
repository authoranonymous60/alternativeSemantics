--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.
C
Because S1 says Sue is the only person who received apples, but S2 says Rob also got apples, which contradicts S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave Bill APPLES.
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.
B
Because S1 talks about Bill getting only apples, and S2 talks about Mary not getting apples. These statements are independent.

2
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.
C
Because S1 says Mary is the only person who got oranges, and S2 says Ellen also got oranges, which contradicts S1.

3
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.
B
Because S1 focuses on Ellen being the only recipient of apples, and S2 talks about Tom not receiving apples. These are independent statements.

4
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.
C
Because S1 says Rob only got bananas, and S2 says Rob also got oranges, which contradicts S1.

5
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill grapes.
A
Because S1 states Bill only got bananas, which implies Bill didn’t get anything else, so S2 saying he didn’t get grapes follows from that. 

6
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.
A
Because S1 declares Ellen only got oranges, which means she didn’t get grapes or other fruits, so S2 is entailed by S1.

7
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.
B
Because S1 focuses on Mary receiving the bananas, and S2 mentions Ellen not getting bananas. These statements are independent.

8
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.
B
Because S1 states Bill is the only recipient of bananas, and S2 talks about Tom not getting any. These are independent statements about different individuals.

9
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.
A
Because S1 says Sue only got oranges, meaning she didn’t receive grapes or other items, so S2 is entailed by S1.
