--- Attempt 1 for f4_cv0 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE", which means Sam did not give apples to anyone else. But S2 says Sam gave apples to Rob, which contradicts this. Therefore, the sentences contradict.

1
S1: Sam only gave Bill APPLES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.
B
Because the focus in S1 is on "APPLES", which means Bill didn’t get anything other than apples. This does not say anything about Mary or anyone else getting apples. S2 talks about Mary not getting apples, which is independent of what S1 says. Therefore, the sentences are independent.

2
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY", meaning Sam did not give oranges to anyone else. But S2 says Sam gave oranges to Ellen, which contradicts S1’s meaning. Therefore, the sentences contradict.

3
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.
B
Because the focus in S1 is on "APPLES", which means that Ellen didn’t get anything besides apples. It says nothing about other people receiving or not receiving apples. S2 talks about Tom not getting apples, which is independent of S1. Therefore, the sentences are independent.

4
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.
B
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB", meaning Rob didn’t receive anything other than bananas. S2 states that Rob also received oranges, which contradicts the idea that Rob only received bananas. Therefore, the sentences are independent (B) because this second sentence changes what Rob received, relating to the object rather than the recipient. It doesn’t contradict the person focus.

5
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill grapes.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL", meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else. This doesn’t exclude the possibility of giving Bill something else—only bananas are mentioned. S2 says Bill didn’t get grapes, which is consistent with S1’s claim. There’s nothing in S1 that says Bill received grapes. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

6
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN", meaning Ellen did not get anything else other than oranges. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes, which fits the idea that Ellen got no fruits other than oranges. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

7
S1: Sam only gave MARY BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.
B
Because the focus in S1 is on "BANANAS", meaning Mary didn’t get any fruit other than bananas. This has nothing to do with whether anyone else got bananas or not. S2 talks about Ellen not getting bananas, which is independent of S1’s claim. Therefore, the sentences are independent.

8
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.
B
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL", meaning Bill didn’t get anything other than bananas. It doesn’t say anything about other people, such as Tom, and what they received. S2 talks about Tom not getting bananas, which is independent of S1’s focus. Therefore, the sentences are independent.

9
S1: Sam only gave SUE ORANGES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES", meaning Sue didn’t get anything other than oranges. S2 says that Sue didn’t get grapes, which fits perfectly with the idea that Sue only got oranges and no other fruit. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.
