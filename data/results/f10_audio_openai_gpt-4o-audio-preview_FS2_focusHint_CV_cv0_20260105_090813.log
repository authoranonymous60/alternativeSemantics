--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Tom APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Tom apples, then he did not give Tom anything else. The statement that he also gave Tom grapes contradicts that.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave Mary BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
B  
Because the statement about what Sam gave or did not give to Bill is independent of what Sam gave to Mary.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, he did not give her anything else. The claim that he also gave her bananas contradicts that.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave Sue APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
B  
Because the statement about what Sam gave Rob is independent of what Sam gave Sue.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Bill bananas, then he did not give Bill anything else. The claim that he also gave Bill grapes contradicts that.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, it is entailed that he did not give Rob any other type of fruit, including apples.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave Sue GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
B  
Because the statement about what Sam gave Tom is independent of what Sam gave Sue.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the statement about what Sam gave Rob is independent of what Sam gave Ellen.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave Mary GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary grapes, then he did not give her anything else. The statement that he also gave her bananas contradicts that.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave Sue APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
B  
Because the statement about what Sam did not give Bill is independent of what Sam gave Sue.
