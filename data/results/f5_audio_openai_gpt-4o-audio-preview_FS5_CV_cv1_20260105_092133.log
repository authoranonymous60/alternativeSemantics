You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the word "only" in S1 focuses on "grapes," implying Sam gave Ellen nothing else. S2 contradicts that by adding oranges.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because S1 emphasizes that Ellen is the only recipient of apples, whereas S2 says another person (Rob) also received apples, which contradicts S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary oranges, then he did not give her anything else, including bananas. S2 is consistent with that.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
C  
Because S1 emphasizes that Mary is the only person who got oranges, while S2 introduces another recipient (Tom), contradicting the exclusivity implied by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because S1 emphasizes Mary as the sole recipient of oranges; it does not say anything about Tom. S2 speaks of Tom’s situation independently of Mary.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because S1 emphasizes that Mary only received grapes, which excludes her receiving any other fruit. S2 contradicts that by saying Mary also received apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because S1 emphasizes that Sue is the only person who received apples, but S2 says Mary also received apples, which contradicts S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because S1 emphasizes that Bill only received oranges. S2 contradicts that by saying Bill also received bananas.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because S1 emphasizes that Ellen only received bananas, which excludes other fruits. S2 contradicts that by saying she also received grapes.

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because if he only gave Tom bananas, he couldn’t have given him oranges, so S2 is entailed by S1.
