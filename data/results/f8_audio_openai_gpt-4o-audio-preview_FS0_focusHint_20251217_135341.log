You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Your output must follow this structure:

S1: ...

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference.  You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," it means Sam didn't give bananas to anyone else. S2 states that Sam also gave bananas to Rob, which contradicts the focus on Ellen only receiving bananas.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB oranges.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "grapes" when given to Rob, it means Sam only gave grapes to Rob in terms of fruit type. S2 talks about oranges, which is unrelated to the restriction about “grapes” and doesn’t contradict or imply anything beyond that.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave BILL apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM," it means Sam did not give apples to anyone else. S2 says that Sam also gave apples to Bill, which contradicts the exclusivity implied in S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave MARY bananas.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "apples" as the only fruit given to Mary, it doesn't restrict what else Mary might have received. S2 talks about Mary receiving bananas, which is a separate type of fruit, making these statements independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave SUE oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," it means Sam didn’t give oranges to anyone else. S2 states Sam also gave oranges to Sue, which contradicts the focus on Ellen.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ROB apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "oranges," it means that oranges were the only thing Sam gave to Rob. This directly entails that Rob did not receive apples, making S2 entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ELLEN bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," it means Sam did not give bananas to anyone else. That entails that Ellen did not receive bananas, so S2 is entailed.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave SUE bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," it means Sam did not give bananas to anyone else. S2 says Sam also gave bananas to Sue, which contradicts the focus on Rob.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give MARY bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," it means Sam did not give bananas to anyone else. Therefore, S2 is entailed, since Mary couldn’t have received bananas.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ROB grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," it means Sam did not give grapes to anyone else. That entails that Rob did not receive grapes, making S2 entailed by S1.
