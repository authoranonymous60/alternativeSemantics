You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the focus is on "SUE," meaning Sam did not give apples to anyone else. S2 contradicts that by stating Sam also gave Rob apples.

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the focus is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave apples only to Bill and no one else. S2 does not add any contradiction since it just states that Mary did not receive apples, which is consistent with S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the focus is on "MARY," meaning Sam did not give oranges to anyone else. S2 contradicts that by saying Sam also gave Ellen oranges.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
B  
Because the focus is on "APPLES," meaning Ellen didn't receive anything else besides apples. S2, which says Tom didn’t get apples, is independent information and does not contradict or entail anything about what Ellen received.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because the focus is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Rob and no one else got bananas. The second sentence contradicts this focus by saying Rob also received oranges.

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on "BILL," meaning Bill only got bananas. Saying he didn't get grapes is consistent with that focus and thus entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on "ELLEN," meaning Ellen only got oranges and nothing else. The second sentence, which says Ellen didn’t get grapes, follows logically and is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on "MARY," meaning only Mary got bananas, so no one else—including Ellen—got bananas. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on "BILL," meaning only Bill got bananas. It follows logically that no one else, including Tom, got bananas. S2 is entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on "SUE," meaning she only got oranges and nothing else. The second sentence, which says she didn’t get grapes, is consistent with and entailed by S1.
