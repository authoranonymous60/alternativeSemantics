You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Your output must follow this structure:

S1: ...
S2: ...

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference.  You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.

S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ROB," it means Sam gave bananas to Rob and not to anyone else. Therefore, it entails that Sam didn't give Tom bananas.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Tom GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "GRAPES," it means that the only thing Sam gave to Tom was grapes and nothing else. Therefore, S2 is entailed, since it states that Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE," it means that Sam gave oranges to Sue and not to anyone else. It does not limit what was given to Sue. Therefore, it does not entail that Sue didn’t get apples. S2 contradicts what would be entailed if the prosodic focus were on "ORANGES," but here the focus is on "SUE," so S2 contradicts the idea that Sue only got oranges.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Sue BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BANANAS," it means that the only thing Sam gave to Sue was bananas and nothing else. It doesn’t say anything about what Sam gave to Rob. However, based on the focused element (bananas), S1 also entails that no one else got bananas. Therefore, S2 is entailed, since it says Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Tom ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," it means that oranges were the only thing Sam gave to Tom and nothing else. Therefore, S2 is entailed since it states that Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "apples," it means that apples were the only thing Sam gave to Sue and nothing else. Therefore, S2 is entailed since it states that Sam didn’t give Sue oranges.

6  
S1: Sam only gave Sue GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "GRAPES," it means that grapes were the only thing Sam gave to Sue and nothing else. Therefore, S2 is entailed since it states that Sam didn’t give Sue apples.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," it means that Sam gave oranges to Ellen and did not give oranges to anyone else. However, it does not limit what was given to Ellen. The second sentence states that Sam also gave Ellen bananas, which contradicts what would be entailed if the focus were on the item (e.g., "oranges"). Thus, S2 contradicts the potential meaning if we considered focus on items, though with the current focus on Ellen the contradiction is clearer since "only Ellen oranges" means no other item information is included. Hence, S2 contradicts the focused meaning.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "MARY," it means that Sam gave grapes to Mary and not to anyone else. This does not directly limit what items Mary got. However, focusing on "grapes" would mean grapes were the only thing Mary got. Therefore, it entails that Mary didn’t get apples. So under the standard reading, S2 is entailed.

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," it means Sam gave oranges to Bill and not to anyone else. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1, as S2 says that oranges were also given to Mary.
