You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Your output must follow this structure:

S1: ...
S2: ...

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference.  You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes  
A  
Because the focus is on "Ellen," it entails that Sam didn't give anyone else grapes, including Tom.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen apples  
C  
Because the focus is on "apples," it means Sam didn’t give Ellen anything other than apples. But S2 contradicts this by saying Sam didn’t give Ellen apples at all.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes  
C  
Because the focus is on "Rob," it means that Sam didn’t give grapes to anyone else besides Rob. S2 contradicts this by stating that Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples  
C  
Because the focus is on "Rob," it entails Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else besides Rob. S2 contradicts this by stating that Sam also gave Ellen apples.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples  
A  
Because the focus is on "Ellen," it means that Sam didn’t give anyone else apples. Therefore, Sam didn’t give Bill apples, which is entailed by S1.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples  
A  
Because the focus is on "Rob," it means Sam didn’t give anyone else apples. Therefore, Sam didn’t give Sue apples, which is entailed by S1.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples  
B  
Because the focus is on "oranges," the sentence means that Sam didn’t give Rob anything other than oranges. S2 introduces a new fact (apples) not related or entailed by S1, making them independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes  
B  
Because the focus is on "apples," it means that Sam didn’t give Rob anything besides apples. S2 introduces a new fact (grapes) unrelated to apples, which makes the two statements independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas  
A  
Because the focus is on "Rob," it means Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone other than Rob, so Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas, which is entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples  
C  
Because the focus is on "Mary," it means Sam didn’t give apples to anyone other than Mary. S2 contradicts this by saying that Sam also gave Ellen apples.
