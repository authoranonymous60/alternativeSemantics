You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Your output must follow this structure:

S1: ...
S2: ...

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference.  You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because focusing on "ROB" entails that Sam gave bananas to Rob and not to anyone else, including Tom.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because focusing on "TOM" entails that Sam gave grapes to Tom and not to anyone else, but it doesn’t say anything about what specific fruits were not given to Tom.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "SUE" and "oranges" means Sam gave oranges to Sue and not anything else to her. Saying that Sam also gave Sue apples directly contradicts that.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
B  
Because focusing on "SUE" and "bananas" means Sam gave bananas only to Sue, and it doesn’t say anything directly about who else received or didn’t receive bananas, so the statement about Rob is independent.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because focusing on "oranges" means that Sam only gave oranges to Tom, so he didn’t give Tom any other fruit, including bananas.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because focusing on "apples" means that Sam gave only apples to Sue, so he didn’t give her any other fruit, including oranges.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because focusing on "grapes" means that Sam only gave grapes to Sue, so he didn’t give her any other fruit, including apples.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because focusing on "oranges" means that Sam gave only oranges to Ellen, so saying he also gave bananas contradicts that.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because focusing on "grapes" means Sam gave only grapes to Mary, so he didn’t give her any other fruit, including apples.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
B  
Because focusing on "BILL" means Sam gave only oranges to Bill, but it doesn’t say anything about what Sam gave to Mary, so that statement is independent.
