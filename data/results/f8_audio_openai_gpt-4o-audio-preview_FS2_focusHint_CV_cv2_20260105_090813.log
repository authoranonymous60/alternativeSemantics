You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on Ellen, meaning Sam did not give bananas to anyone else besides Ellen. Since S2 says Sam also gave Rob bananas, that contradicts S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on the type of fruit (grapes). This means Sam only gave Rob grapes and no other fruit to Rob. S2 talks about oranges, which is unrelated to the exclusive statement about grapes and does not contradict or follow from S1. Therefore, they are independent.

2  
S1: Sam only gave Tom APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on Tom, meaning only Tom received apples. If S2 says that Sam also gave Bill apples, that contradicts the statement in S1 that only Tom got apples.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on the type of fruit (apples). That means Sam only gave Mary apples and nothing else. If S2 says Sam also gave Mary bananas, that contradicts the exclusive statement in S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on the type of fruit (oranges) given to Ellen. That means Ellen only got oranges, and nothing else. S2 talks about Sue, which is independent of who Ellen got fruit from, so this is independent.

5  
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on the type of fruit (oranges). That means Rob only got oranges, so he did not get any other fruit. S2 (that Rob didn't get apples) follows directly from this focus.

6  
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on Bill, meaning only Bill received bananas. This doesn't say anything about Ellen getting bananas or not, so S2 is independent from S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave Rob BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on Rob, meaning Sam did not give bananas to anyone else besides Rob. S2 says Sam also gave Sue bananas, which directly contradicts the exclusive focus of S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on Bill, meaning that only Bill got bananas and no one else did. If that is true, then S2, which says that Mary didn’t get bananas, logically follows from it.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on Ellen, meaning Sam only gave grapes to Ellen and no one else. If that is true, then S2, which says that Rob didn’t get grapes, follows directly from that.
