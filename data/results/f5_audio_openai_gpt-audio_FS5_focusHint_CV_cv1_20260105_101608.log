--- Attempt 1 for f5_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam didn't give grapes to anyone else. S2 introduces giving oranges to Ellen, which contradicts the 'only' scope in S1 that implies focus on the restriction of the recipient, not the item. S1 does not restrict other items to Ellen, so it doesn't contradict based on that, but the actual phrasing implies exclusivity of giving grapes. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam did not give apples to anyone other than Ellen. S2 says Sam also gave apples to Rob, which contradicts the exclusivity of giving apples to Ellen alone. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam did not give oranges to anyone else other than Mary. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Mary bananas, which is consistent with S1 because S1 does not say anything about giving Mary other fruits. The focus on the recipient in S1 means exclusivity applies to the recipient of oranges, not to bananas or other items. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave TOM oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam did not give oranges to anyone else other than Mary. S2 says that Sam also gave Tom oranges, which directly contradicts the exclusivity of the recipient established in S1. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give TOM oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam did not give oranges to anyone else other than Mary. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Tom oranges, which supports the exclusivity of giving oranges only to Mary. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "GRAPES," meaning Sam did not give anything other than grapes to Mary. S2 says Sam also gave Mary apples, which contradicts the exclusivity of the item established by focusing on grapes. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "APPLES," meaning Sam did not give anything else to Sue besides apples. S2 introduces giving apples to Mary, which does not contradict that exclusivity on Sue’s side in terms of items. But the exclusivity in S1 makes the statement about apples restrictive to Sue. So S2, by introducing giving apples to someone else, contradicts the narrow focus on Sue as the exclusive recipient. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam didn’t give anything else other than oranges to Bill. S2 says Sam also gave Bill bananas, which contradicts the exclusivity of the item given to Bill. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BANANAS," meaning Sam didn’t give anything else to Ellen. S2 says Sam also gave Ellen grapes, which contradicts the exclusivity of the item established in S1. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BANANAS," meaning Sam didn’t give anything else other than bananas to Tom. S2 confirms that Sam didn’t give Tom oranges, which fits perfectly with the exclusivity of the item. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.
