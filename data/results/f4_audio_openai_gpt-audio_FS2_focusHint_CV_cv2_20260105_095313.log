You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "SUE," meaning Sam didn't give apples to anyone else. S2 says Sam gave apples to Rob, which contradicts the focus that Sue is the only apple recipient.

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave apples to Bill and no one else. S2 says Sam didn't give Mary apples, which aligns with the fact that only Bill received apples.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave oranges to Mary and no one else. S2 says Sam gave Ellen oranges too, which contradicts the statement that only Mary got oranges.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave apples to Ellen and no one else. S2 says Sam didn't give Tom apples, which is consistent with the focus that Ellen was the sole recipient.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on "ROB," meaning only Rob got bananas. S2 talks about giving Rob oranges, which is independent: it discusses something other than bananas, so it doesn't contradict or entail S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "BANANAS," meaning Bill got no other fruit than bananas. S2 states Sam didn't give Bill grapes, which fits this expectation and is thus entailed.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave oranges only to Ellen and no one else received oranges. S2 talks about grapes and not giving them to Ellen, which aligns with the idea that oranges were the only thing she got and nothing else.

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave bananas to Mary and no one else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas, which is consistent with the claim that Mary was the only banana recipient.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave bananas to Bill and no one else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Tom bananas, which matches that Bill alone received them.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "oranges," meaning for Sue, the only thing Sam gave her was oranges, and not any other fruit. S2 says Sam didn’t give Sue grapes, which is entailed by the fact that oranges were the only gift.
