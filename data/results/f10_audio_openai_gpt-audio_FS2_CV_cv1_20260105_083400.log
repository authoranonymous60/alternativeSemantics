--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.
C
Because S1 says that Tom got only apples, and S2 says Tom also got grapes, which contradicts the focus on exclusivity in S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.
B
Because S2 talks about Bill and not Mary, so it’s an independent statement unrelated to the exclusive giving to Mary in S1.

2
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
B
Because S1 limits the giving to apples, and S2 introduces bananas for Mary, so the statements are independent.

3
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.
A
Because S1 places the focus on Sue getting apples exclusively, and S2 doesn’t conflict with that—it just adds that Rob didn’t get apples, which is compatible.

4
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.
C
Because S1 says Bill got nothing but bananas, and S2 says he got grapes too, contradicting the exclusivity claimed in S1.

5
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.
A
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, then Rob didn’t get apples, which is what S2 says. They align, so S2 is entailed by S1.

6
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.
B
Because S2 talks about Tom, not Sue. Whether Tom got grapes is independent of Sue’s exclusive receiving of grapes in S1.

7
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.
B
Because S1 talks about Ellen’s exclusive receipt of grapes, while S2 discusses what Rob didn’t get. These are independent.

8
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
C
Because S1 says Mary got only grapes, and S2 says she also got bananas, which contradicts the exclusivity stated in S1.

9
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.
A
Because S1 says only Sue got apples, implying no one else did, which entails that Bill didn’t get apples as stated in S2.
