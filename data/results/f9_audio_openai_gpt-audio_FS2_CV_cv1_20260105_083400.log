--- Attempt 1 for f9_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the second sentence contradicts the first. The word "only" in S1 means Sam didn’t give Ellen anything besides bananas, but S2 states that Sam also gave Ellen grapes.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because the second sentence is entailed by the first. If Sam only gave Mary apples, it follows that he didn’t give her oranges or anything else.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the second sentence contradicts the first. S1 says Sam only gave Tom bananas, so S2 introducing apples contradicts that.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because the second sentence is entailed by the first. If Sam only gave Mary apples, then it’s entailed that Sam didn’t give Mary grapes.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the second sentence is entailed by the first. If Sam only gave Mary oranges, then he didn’t give her apples or anything else.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because the second sentence doesn’t contradict or follow from the first. S1 talks about what Sam gave Rob, while S2 talks about Mary. They are independent events.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
B  
Because the second sentence is independent of the first. S1 restricts giving to Rob only, but it does not rule out giving apples to Tom in a separate context.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the second sentence is entailed by the first. If Sam only gave Rob oranges, then he did not give him bananas.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the second sentence is independent. The first sentence limits what Bill got, but says nothing about what Rob got.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the second sentence contradicts the first. S1 says Rob only got grapes, but S2 says he also got bananas.
