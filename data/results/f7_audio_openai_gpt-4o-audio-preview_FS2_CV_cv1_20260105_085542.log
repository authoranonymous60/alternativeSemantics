--- Attempt 1 for f7_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because the first sentence states that Bill only received bananas from Sam, but the second sentence suggests that Bill also received grapes, which contradicts the exclusivity implied in S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the first sentence claims that only Mary received apples, but the second sentence suggests that Ellen also received apples, contradicting the exclusivity in S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
B  
Because the first sentence limits the receiver of apples to Sue, but the second sentence talks about Tom getting apples, so it provides new information without contradicting or entailing S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill oranges.  
B  
Because the first sentence focuses on Bill only receiving grapes, and the second sentence states he didn’t get oranges. While this is consistent with the first, it doesn’t necessarily follow directly from it, so it’s independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because if Bill only received apples, it logically follows that he didn’t receive bananas or any other fruit. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because if Sue only received apples, it follows naturally that she didn’t get bananas or any other fruit. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because S1 restricts the giving of oranges to Ellen, but S2 talks about Tom not receiving oranges. S2 doesn’t directly entail or contradict S1, so they are independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if Tom was the only one who received apples, then it necessarily follows that Mary didn’t receive any apples. S2 is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because the first sentence says Tom was the only one who got apples, and the second sentence suggests Bill also got apples, which contradicts the exclusivity of S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because if Sue is the only one who received bananas, it follows that Tom (and anyone else) didn’t receive any bananas. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.
