You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave MARY apples.  
B  
Because the second sentence introduces a new recipient, Mary, which is independent of the prosodic focus on "ROB" in the first sentence. The two sentences do not entail or contradict each other since the scope in S1 is focused on Rob, and S2 introduces Mary separately.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave TOM apples.  
B  
Because the second sentence talks about giving apples to Tom, while the first focuses on Rob. These are different individuals, and the second sentence is independent from the exclusivity implied in the first sentence.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give ROB bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, then giving Rob bananas would be excluded. Therefore, the second sentence—that Sam didn’t give Rob bananas—logically follows from the exclusivity in the first sentence.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB grapes.  
C  
Because the first sentence claims that the only person Sam gave grapes to was Bill, so the second sentence, stating that Sam also gave Rob grapes, contradicts this.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB bananas.  
C  
Because the first sentence limits Sam’s gift to Rob to grapes only, so stating that Sam also gave Rob bananas contradicts that exclusivity.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB oranges.  
C  
Because the first sentence says that Mary was the only recipient of oranges, but the second sentence claims that Rob also received oranges, directly contradicting the first.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give ROB oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob bananas, that means Rob received no other fruits. Therefore, it follows that Sam didn’t give Rob oranges. The second sentence is entailed by the first.

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB grapes.  
B  
Because the first sentence states exclusivity about who received apples (only Bill), but says nothing about what happened with grapes. The second sentence, about giving grapes to Rob, introduces a separate scenario and is independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB bananas.  
C  
Because the first sentence states exclusivity that Rob only received grapes. The second sentence claims that Rob also received bananas, directly contradicting the exclusivity.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB bananas.  
C  
Because, as before, the first sentence claims Rob only got grapes, and the second sentence contradicts that by adding bananas.
