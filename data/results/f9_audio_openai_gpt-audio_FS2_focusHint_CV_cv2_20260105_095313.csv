The sentence does not restrict what Tom received. S2 says Sam also gave Tom apples. This contradicts the meaning if the focus were on ""bananas"" (only bananas), but here the focus is on ""TOM."" Therefore, it contradicts the interpretation that Tom only got bananas and nothing else. The intended meaning matched a restriction on who got bananas, not what Tom got. But S2 directly contradicts the interpretation involving what Tom received when based on the common reading.
