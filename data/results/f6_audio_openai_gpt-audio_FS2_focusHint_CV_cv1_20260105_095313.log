You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ROB", meaning Sam gave apples to no one else. S2 states that Sam didn't give Sue apples, which is consistent with S1. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "GRAPES", meaning the only thing Sam gave Sue was grapes. S2 says Sam also gave Sue oranges, which contradicts the idea that grapes were the only thing Sam gave Sue. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE", meaning that the only person who got grapes from Sam was Sue, and no other person got grapes. This does not specify what else Sue might have received, but it does not contradict S2, which says Sam didn’t give Sue bananas. Therefore, S2 is independent of the focus. Given the classification, S2 is consistent with S1, and it can be inferred that S2 is entailed.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "GRAPES", meaning the only thing Sam gave Mary was grapes, and it places no restriction on whether Sam also gave grapes to others. S2 says that Sam also gave Ellen grapes, which does not contradict S1. It simply provides another independent fact. Therefore, S2 is independent of S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ORANGES", meaning that oranges were the only thing Sam gave Rob. S2 states that Sam also gave Rob bananas, which contradicts that focus. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BANANAS", meaning that the only thing Sam gave Sue was bananas. S2 states that Sam didn't give Sue grapes, which aligns with the idea that Sue only got bananas and nothing else. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave TOM GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "GRAPES", meaning that grapes were the only thing Sam gave Tom. S2 states that Sam didn't give Tom apples, which is consistent with the idea that Tom got only grapes. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BANANAS", meaning that bananas were the only thing Sam gave Tom. S2 states that Sam didn't give Tom grapes, which aligns with this claim. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "APPLES", meaning that apples were the only thing Sam gave Rob. S2 states that Sam also gave Rob grapes, which contradicts the exclusive focus on apples in S1. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "GRAPES", meaning that grapes were the only thing Sam gave Ellen. S2 states that Sam also gave Ellen oranges, which contradicts the exclusivity implied in S1. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.
