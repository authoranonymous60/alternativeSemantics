You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Your output must follow this structure:

S1: ...
S2: ...

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference.  You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because focusing on "Ellen" means that no one else but Ellen received bananas. However, saying Sam also gave Ellen grapes suggests that Ellen got something else besides bananas, which contradicts "only" focusing on Ellen.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because focusing on "Mary" means no one else but Mary received apples. The statement that Sam didn’t give Mary oranges is consistent with S1, as it limits what Mary received to only apples.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "Tom" means no one but Tom received bananas. But S2 says Sam also gave Tom apples, which contradicts the idea that Tom only got bananas.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because focusing on "Mary" means no one else but Mary received apples. Saying Mary didn’t get grapes supports the focus that Mary only received apples.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because focusing on "Mary" means no one else but Mary received oranges. Saying Mary didn’t get apples is consistent because the focus ensures she only got oranges.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "Rob" means only Rob got apples. But S2 says Mary also got apples, contradicting that exclusivity.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "Rob" means only Rob got apples. If Tom also got apples, that contradicts the statement.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because focusing on "Rob" means no one but Rob received oranges. Saying he didn’t get bananas is consistent since the focus is only on Rob getting oranges.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because focusing on "Bill" means only Bill got grapes. Saying Rob also got grapes contradicts that exclusivity.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
B  
Because focusing on "Rob" means only Rob got grapes. Saying Rob also got bananas doesn’t contradict or confirm that, as the focus is on what was exclusively given in terms of grapes, not other fruits.
