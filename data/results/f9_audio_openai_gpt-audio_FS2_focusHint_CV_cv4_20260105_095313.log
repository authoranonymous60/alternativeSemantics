You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

--- Raw Model Output ---

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else. S2 states that Sam also gave Ellen grapes, which introduces a different item given to Ellen, contradicting the meaning that only bananas were given to Ellen.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY," and it states that Mary only received apples. S2 aligns with this by saying Sam didn’t give Mary oranges, confirming that apples were the only thing given to Mary.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM," meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else. S2 says Sam also gave Tom apples, contradicting the idea that the only thing Tom got was bananas.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Mary only got apples. S2 confirms that Sam didn’t give Mary grapes, which is consistent with only apples being given to Mary.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam didn’t give anything else to Mary apart from oranges. S2 confirms that Mary didn’t get apples, which supports the statement in S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave MARY apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning only Rob got apples. S2 contradicts this by saying that Mary also got apples, which breaks the exclusivity established in S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave TOM apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning only Rob got apples. S2 contradicts this by saying that Tom also got apples, which is inconsistent with the exclusivity established in S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam didn’t give anything else to Rob besides oranges. S2 confirms that Rob didn’t receive bananas, which is consistent with the exclusivity of oranges in S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning only Bill got grapes. S2 says that Rob also got grapes, contradicting the exclusivity set by S1’s focus.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "GRAPES," meaning grapes were the only thing Sam gave Rob. S2 says Rob also got bananas, which contradicts the exclusivity set by S1.
