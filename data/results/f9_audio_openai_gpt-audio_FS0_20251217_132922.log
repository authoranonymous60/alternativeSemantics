You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Understood. I’ll now transcribe each S1 and S2 from the provided audio, mark the prosodic focus in S1 using uppercase, and classify S2 relative to S1. 

Let’s proceed step-by-step.

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because S1’s focus on “ELLEN” and “bananas” suggests exclusivity, meaning Ellen received only bananas and nothing else. S2 contradicts this by stating Ellen received grapes as well.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because S1’s focus on “MARY” and “apples” implies that Mary received only apples and nothing else. S2 aligns with that, saying Mary didn’t get oranges.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because S1 focuses on “TOM” and “bananas,” meaning Tom received only bananas. S2 contradicts this by stating that Tom also got apples.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because S1 emphasizes that Mary only received apples. S2 is consistent by stating that Mary didn’t get grapes.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because S1’s focus on “MARY” and “oranges” excludes other fruits. S2 supports this by indicating Mary didn’t receive apples.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because S1 focuses on “ROB” and “apples,” and says nothing about anyone else. S2 introduces a new fact about Mary, which is independent.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
B  
Because S1 is about Rob and apples only. S2 is a separate fact about Tom, making it independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because S1’s focus on “ROB” and “oranges” excludes any other fruit. S2 agrees by stating Rob didn’t receive bananas.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because S1 focuses on Bill and grapes, and S2 brings up a different person, Rob, making it independent.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because S1 focuses on “ROB” and “grapes,” meaning that Rob exclusively received grapes. S2 contradicts this by stating Rob also received bananas. 

This completes the task. Each pair has been transcribed, the prosodic focus marked, and S2 classified relative to S1.
