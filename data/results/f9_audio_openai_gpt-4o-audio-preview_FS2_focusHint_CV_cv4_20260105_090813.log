You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on Ellen, meaning Sam did not give bananas to anyone else except Ellen. S2 contradicts this by stating that Sam also gave Ellen grapes, which means Ellen received something else besides bananas.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on apples, meaning Sam gave Mary only apples and nothing else. S2 is entailed since it confirms that Sam didn’t give Mary oranges, which aligns with S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on Tom, meaning Sam did not give bananas to anyone else except Tom. S2 contradicts S1 by adding that Tom also received apples, meaning he received more than just bananas.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on apples, meaning Mary received only apples and nothing else. S2 is entailed because if Mary only got apples, she didn’t get grapes as well.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Mary ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on oranges, meaning Mary only received oranges and nothing else. S2 is entailed by this as it confirms Mary didn’t get apples.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on Rob, meaning Sam only gave apples to Rob and no one else received apples. S2 contradicts this by saying Mary also got apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on Rob, meaning Rob is the only person who got apples. S2 contradicts this by stating Tom also received apples.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on oranges, meaning Rob only got oranges and nothing else. S2 is entailed because if Rob only received oranges, then he did not receive bananas.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on Bill, meaning Bill is the only one who got grapes. S2 contradicts that by stating Rob also got grapes.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on grapes, meaning Rob only received grapes and nothing else. S2 contradicts this by saying Rob also got bananas.
