--- Attempt 1 for f10_cv0 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave Tom APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.
C
Because the second sentence contradicts the first: if Sam only gave Tom apples, it means no other items like grapes were given to Tom, but S2 says Sam also gave him grapes.

1
S1: Sam only gave Mary BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.
B
Because the second sentence talks about Bill, who is a different person than Mary, so it is independent. S1 focuses on what Mary received, and S2 is about Bill’s situation, which does not affect the truth of S1.

2
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
C
Because S1 says Sam only gave Mary apples, meaning no other fruit was given to her. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave Mary bananas.

3
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.
B
Because S1 focuses on Sue, and S2 focuses on Rob; the two sentences are about different people and do not overlap in terms of defining the same event or action. Thus, they are independent.

4
S1: Sam only gave BILL BANANAS.
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.
C
Because S1 says Sam only gave Bill bananas, meaning no other items like grapes were given. S2 contradicts this by stating that Bill got grapes too.

5
S1: Sam only gave ROB GRAPES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.
A
Because S1 says Sam only gave Rob grapes, which means Rob didn’t get anything else, including apples. S2’s statement that Sam didn’t give Rob apples is consistent with this and therefore entailed by S1.

6
S1: Sam only gave SUE GRAPES.
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.
B
Because S1 is about what Sue received (only grapes), and S2 is about what Tom received. Whether or not Tom got grapes is a separate fact from what Sue received, so these statements are independent.

7
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN GRAPES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.
B
Because S1 says Sam only gave Ellen grapes, addressing a specific fact about Ellen, and S2 discusses what Rob got (or didn’t get). They talk about different individuals and do not contradict or confirm each other directly.

8
S1: Sam only gave MARY GRAPES.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
C
Because S1 says Sam only gave Mary grapes, meaning no other items were given to her. S2 contradicts this by stating that Mary also got bananas.

9
S1: Sam only gave SUE APPLES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.
B
Because S1 talks about Sue getting only apples, and S2 talks about what Bill didn’t get. They concern different individuals, so S2 is independent of S1.
