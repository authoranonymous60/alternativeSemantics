--- Attempt 1 for f3_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, it is entailed that Tom did not receive grapes from Sam.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.  
C  
Because S1 says that Sam only gave Ellen apples, implying he did give her apples, while S2 says the opposite, that he didn’t give her apples.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
B  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, then giving grapes to Ellen would contradict the exclusivity, making the statements independent.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
B  
Because the first sentence implies exclusivity to Rob, making the second sentence about Ellen independent or contradictory depending on whether the focus shifts, but still not entailed.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen apples, it follows that he did not give them to anyone else, including Bill.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, it entails that he didn’t give apples to Sue or anyone else.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the first sentence limits what was given to oranges, while the second sentence contradicts or adds a new element about apples, making the statements independent.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the exclusivity in the first statement about apples is contradicted by the second statement adding grapes, so they are independent.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if the giving was exclusive to Rob, then no one else, like Ellen, received bananas, which is entailed.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the first sentence about exclusivity to Mary is contradicted by the second sentence about also giving apples to Ellen.
