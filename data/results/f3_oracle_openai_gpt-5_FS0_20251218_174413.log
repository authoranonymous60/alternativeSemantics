0
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
A
Because “only … ELLEN … grapes” means Ellen was the sole recipient of grapes, so Tom did not get grapes.

1
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen oranges.
A
Because “only … APPLES” means Ellen received no items other than apples, so not oranges.

2
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
B
Because “only … GRAPES” limits what Rob received (only grapes) but doesn’t restrict who else got grapes; Ellen may also have received grapes.

3
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.
B
Because the restriction is only on what Rob received (only apples), not on whether others (like Ellen) also got apples.

4
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.
B
Because limiting Ellen’s items to apples says nothing about whether Bill received apples.

5
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.
B
Because limiting Rob’s items to apples says nothing about whether Sue received apples.

6
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.
B
Because “only … ROB … oranges” means Rob was the sole recipient of oranges; it doesn’t forbid also giving Rob apples.

7
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.
B
Because “only … ROB … apples” means Rob was the sole recipient of apples; it doesn’t forbid also giving Rob grapes.

8
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.
A
Because only Rob received bananas, so Ellen did not.

9
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.
B
Because the restriction concerns what Mary received, not whether Ellen also received apples.
