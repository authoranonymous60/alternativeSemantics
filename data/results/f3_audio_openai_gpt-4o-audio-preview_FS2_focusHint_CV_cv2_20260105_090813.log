You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave grapes to Ellen, it entails that Sam didn’t give grapes to anyone else, including Tom.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen apples, it means he did give her apples, but the second sentence contradicts this by saying he didn’t give her apples.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave grapes to Rob, that means he didn’t give grapes to anyone else, but the second sentence states that he also gave grapes to Ellen, which contradicts that.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Rob, it entails that no one else received apples. The second sentence states he also gave apples to Ellen, which contradicts that.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Ellen, it entails that he didn’t give apples to anyone else, including Bill.

5  
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Rob, it entails that he didn’t give apples to anyone else, including Sue.

6  
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because focusing on oranges means Sam didn’t give Rob anything else other than oranges. This does not entail or contradict the second sentence, which is about apples— a different category.

7  
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because if the focus is on apples, it means Sam didn’t give Rob anything else that is apples. However, that doesn’t rule out giving him other fruits like grapes, so the statements are independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave Rob BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave bananas to Rob, it entails that no one else received bananas, including Ellen.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Mary, it means no one else got apples. The second sentence says he also gave Ellen apples, which contradicts that.
