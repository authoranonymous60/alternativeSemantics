--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because S1 emphasizes that Sue is the only person who received apples, so S2 contradicts it by saying someone else also got apples.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Bill APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
B  
Because S1 talks about what Sam gave Bill, while S2 talks about what Sam did not give to Mary. These statements are independent.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because S1 means that Mary is the only person who got oranges, but S2 says Ellen also got oranges, which contradicts S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
B  
Because S1 specifies who received apples (only Ellen), and S2 states that Tom didn’t receive apples. These statements are independent since they refer to different people directly.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
B  
Because S1 is about which single item Rob received (only bananas), but S2 talks about Rob receiving a different fruit (oranges), which doesn't contradict or entail S1. They are about different items.

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because if Bill only got bananas, it follows that he didn’t get grapes. So S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because if Ellen only received oranges, it is implied that she didn’t receive any other fruit, like grapes. S2 is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
B  
Because S1 states that Mary is the only recipient of bananas, but it doesn’t directly say anything about Ellen. S2 simply adds information about Ellen, making them independent statements.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
B  
Because S1 talks exclusively about what Bill received (bananas) and doesn’t say anything about Tom. S2 is an independent statement about Tom not receiving bananas.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because if Sue only got oranges, she did not get any other fruit, such as grapes. S2 is therefore entailed by S1.
