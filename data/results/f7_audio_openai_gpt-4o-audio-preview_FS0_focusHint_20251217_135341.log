You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Your output must follow this structure:

S1: ...
S2: ...

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference.  You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.

S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because S1, with prosodic focus on "BILL," means that Sam didn't give bananas to anyone other than Bill. However, S2 introduces that Sam also gave Bill grapes, which doesn’t contradict the exclusive nature of S1's focus. Instead, it contradicts the implication that Bill only received bananas. Hence, S2 contradicts the inferred exclusivity introduced by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because S1, with prosodic focus on "MARY," means that Sam didn't give apples to anyone other than Mary. S2 directly contradicts this by stating that Sam also gave apples to Ellen.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because S1, with prosodic focus on "SUE," implies that Sue was the only recipient of apples. S2 contradicts this by stating that Tom also received apples.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because S1, with prosodic focus on "BILL," means that Sam gave grapes exclusively to Bill, and not any other person or any other item to Bill. S2 supports this by stating that Bill didn’t get oranges, which aligns with the exclusivity from S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because S1, with prosodic focus on "BILL," means Sam gave apples exclusively to Bill (and no other person or item to Bill). Given this, S2, which claims Sam didn’t give Bill bananas, is entailed because the focus of S1 rules out any other items being given to Bill.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because S1, with prosodic focus on "SUE," means that Sue is the only person who received apples and that she didn’t receive any other fruits. Thus, S2 is entailed as it indicates Sue didn't receive bananas, which is consistent with S1's exclusivity.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because S1, with prosodic focus on "ELLEN," means that Ellen is the only recipient of oranges. S2 states that Tom didn’t get any oranges, which is additional and independent information that does not follow directly from S1, but is not in contradiction either.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because S1, with prosodic focus on "TOM," means that Tom is the sole recipient of apples. Therefore, S2 is entailed since it aligns with the idea that no one else (like Mary) received apples.

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because S1, placing focus on "TOM," means Tom is the only person who received apples. S2 contradicts this by stating that Bill also received apples, directly opposing the exclusivity implied by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because S1, with prosodic focus on "SUE," means that Sue is the only recipient of bananas. Thus, S2 is entailed as it states that Tom did not receive any bananas, consistent with S1's exclusive focus.
