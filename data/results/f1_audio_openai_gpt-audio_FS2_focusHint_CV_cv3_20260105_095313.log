You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam didn't give grapes to anyone else, but S2 says Sam also gave Sue grapes, which contradicts S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam didn't give oranges to anyone else, but S2 says Sam also gave Rob oranges, which contradicts S1.

2
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam only gave grapes to Sue and not to anyone else, so S2 is entailed since it says Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.

3
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "apples," meaning Sam only gave apples to Tom, so he didn't give Tom anything else, and S2 is entailed since it says Sam didn't give Tom grapes.

4
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "oranges," meaning Sam didn't give anything else to Rob except oranges, but S2 says Sam also gave Rob apples, which contradicts S1.

5
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
B
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam only gave grapes to Sue and not anyone else, but S2 talks about Tom and not Sue, making it independent because it focuses on a different individual.

6
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam didn't give bananas to anyone else, but S2 says Sam also gave Mary bananas, which contradicts S1.

7
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam only gave bananas to Rob and not anything else, so S2 is entailed since it says Sam didn't give Rob oranges.

8
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "bananas," meaning Sam didn't give anything else to Mary except bananas, but S2 says Sam also gave Mary apples, which contradicts S1.

9
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.
B
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam only gave oranges to Sue and not anyone else, but S2 talks about Rob and not Sue, making it independent because it focuses on a different individual.
