You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because in S1 the focus is on BILL, meaning Sam gave bananas to Bill and not to anyone else. However, S2 says Sam also gave Bill grapes, introducing something else given to Bill, which contradicts the exclusivity implied by "only" in S1.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because in S1 the focus is on MARY, meaning Sam gave apples only to Mary and no one else. S2 contradicts that by saying that Ellen also received apples.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because in S1 the focus is on SUE, meaning Sam gave apples only to Sue and not to anyone else. S2 contradicts that by stating that Tom also received apples.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because in S1 the focus is on GRAPES, meaning that grapes are the only thing Sam gave Bill. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Bill oranges, which aligns with the idea that grapes were the only thing given.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because in S1 the focus is on APPLES, meaning apples are the only thing Sam gave Bill. S2 aligns with that by stating that Sam did not give Bill bananas.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because in S1 the focus is on APPLES, meaning apples are the only thing Sam gave Sue. S2 confirms that by stating that Sue didn’t receive bananas, which is consistent with apples being the sole gift.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because in S1 the focus is on ELLEN, meaning Sam gave oranges only to Ellen and no one else. S2 confirms this by stating Sam didn’t give Tom oranges, which fits the exclusivity implied by S1.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because in S1 the focus is on TOM, meaning Sam gave apples only to Tom and no one else. S2 confirms this by stating that Mary didn’t receive apples.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because in S1 the focus is on TOM, meaning Sam gave apples only to Tom and no one else. S2 contradicts this by stating that Bill also received apples.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because in S1 the focus is on SUE, meaning Sam gave bananas only to Sue and no one else. S2 confirms that Tom didn’t receive bananas, which is consistent with the exclusivity in S1.
