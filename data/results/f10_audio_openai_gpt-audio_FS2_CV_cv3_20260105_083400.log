--- Attempt 1 for f10_cv3 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because the first sentence says Tom only got apples, and the second sentence says Tom also got grapes, directly contradicting the exclusivity in S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
B  
Because the first sentence is about Mary receiving bananas, and the second sentence is about Bill not receiving bananas. These statements are independent since they refer to different people.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the first sentence says Mary only received apples, while the second says she also received bananas, which contradicts the exclusivity in S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
B  
Because the first sentence is about Sue receiving apples, and the second is about Rob not receiving apples. These statements involve different individuals and do not influence each other.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because the first sentence says Bill only got bananas, while the second says he also got grapes, contradicting the exclusivity in S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, it follows logically that he didn't give Rob apples. The second sentence is entailed by the exclusivity in S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
B  
Because the first sentence refers to Sue receiving grapes exclusively, and the second introduces new information about Tom. They are independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, it follows that Rob did not receive grapes. The second sentence is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the first sentence says Mary only got grapes, and the second sentence says she also got bananas, which contradicts the exclusivity in S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
B  
Because the first sentence is about Sue receiving apples, while the second is about Bill not receiving apples. These two statements are independent.
