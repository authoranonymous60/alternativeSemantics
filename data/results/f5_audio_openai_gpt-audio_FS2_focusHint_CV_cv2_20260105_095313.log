You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave grapes only to Ellen and no one else. S2 states that Sam gave Ellen oranges as well. This contradicts the claim in S1 that Ellen only received grapes and nothing else.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN." This entails that Ellen was the only recipient of apples from Sam, and no one else received apples. S2 says that Rob also got apples, which contradicts the claim in S1.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam gave Mary only oranges and not any other item. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Mary bananas, which aligns with the claim in S1 that Mary only received oranges.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave TOM oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY." This means Mary was the only recipient of oranges. S2 says that Tom also got oranges, which contradicts the exclusivity of Mary receiving the oranges described in S1.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give TOM oranges.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Mary was the only recipient of oranges. S2 talks about what Tom didn’t receive. That’s independent from what S1 claims, so S2 doesn't contradict or confirm S1 directly.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "GRAPES," meaning Sam gave Mary only grapes and nothing else. S2 states that Sam also gave Mary apples, which contradicts S1’s exclusive meaning that Mary only got grapes.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave MARY apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE." This means Sue was the only recipient of apples. S2 says that Mary also got apples, contradicting the exclusivity stated in S1.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave BILL bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES." This means Bill only got oranges and nothing else. S2 says that Bill also got bananas, contradicting the exclusivity of the oranges mentioned in S1.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BANANAS," meaning Ellen only received bananas and nothing else. S2 says Ellen also received grapes, which contradicts S1’s exclusivity.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BANANAS," meaning Tom only got bananas and not any other items. S2 says that Tom didn’t get oranges, which is consistent with the exclusivity stated in S1.
