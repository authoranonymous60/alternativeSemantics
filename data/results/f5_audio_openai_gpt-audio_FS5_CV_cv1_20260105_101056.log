You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because "only gave Ellen GRAPES" means grapes and nothing else. The statement that Sam also gave Ellen oranges contradicts that exclusivity.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the focus is on who received apples. S1 says that Sam only gave apples to Ellen, not that apples were the only thing given. S2 talks about Rob receiving apples, which is a separate event and does not contradict that Ellen was the sole apples recipient in one context.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary oranges, it means no other fruits were given to her. Therefore, it directly follows that Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on Mary receiving oranges exclusively, meaning Mary got no other fruit. This doesn’t exclude Sam from giving the same fruit to someone else like Tom. The two pieces of information are independent.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the focus is on Mary being the exclusive recipient of oranges in the original statement. It does not speak to whether or not Tom got them as well. Thus, the statements don’t relate directly to each other—Tom isn’t mentioned in S1 at all—so they are independent.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave Mary GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary grapes, it means no apples were given. Stating that Sam also gave Mary apples contradicts this.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the statement focuses on Sue being the sole recipient of apples. If Sam also gave apples to Mary, that contradicts the idea that Sue was the exclusive recipient.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave Bill ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Bill oranges, it implies Bill got no other fruit. Saying Sam gave Bill bananas contradicts that exclusive claim.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if Ellen only received bananas, it excludes any other fruit. The claim that Sam also gave Ellen grapes directly contradicts that.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave Tom BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because if Tom only got bananas, it follows that he didn’t receive any oranges. This is entailed by the exclusivity of "only bananas."
