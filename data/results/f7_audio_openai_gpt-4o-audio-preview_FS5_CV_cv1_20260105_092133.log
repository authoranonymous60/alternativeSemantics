--- Attempt 1 for f7_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Bill bananas, then giving him grapes contradicts that exclusivity.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, then giving Ellen apples contradicts that exclusivity.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Sue apples, then giving Tom apples contradicts the exclusivity.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill grapes, then it's consistent that Sam didn’t give Bill oranges.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill apples, then it’s consistent that he didn’t give Bill bananas.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
B  
Because saying that Sam only gave Sue apples doesn't necessarily entail or contradict that he didn't give Sue bananas. They are separate facts.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen oranges, it follows that he didn’t give oranges to Tom.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom apples, then it follows that he didn’t give Mary apples, as the exclusivity indicates Tom is the only recipient of apples.

8  
S1: Sam only gave Tom APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Tom apples, then giving Bill apples contradicts that exclusivity.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Sue BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue bananas, then it follows that Sam did not give Tom bananas. The exclusivity implies Sue is the only banana recipient.
