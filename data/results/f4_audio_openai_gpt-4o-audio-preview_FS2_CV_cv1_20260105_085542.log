--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because S1 says Sam only gave apples to Sue, which means he did not give apples to anyone else. S2 contradicts that by saying Sam also gave Rob apples.

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
B  
Because S1 is about who received apples (only Bill), but S2 is about someone else (Mary) not receiving apples. These statements don’t entail or contradict each other; they are independent.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because S1 says Mary was the only one who received oranges, but S2 states Ellen also received oranges, directly contradicting the exclusivity implied in S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.  
B  
Because S1 is about Ellen being the only recipient of apples, while S2 talks about Tom not receiving apples. There’s no direct entailment or contradiction; the statements are independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
B  
Because S1 focuses on what Sam gave to Rob (only bananas), and S2 mentions Sam also gave Rob oranges. There is no contradiction or entailment between giving bananas and giving oranges since they're different items. The two statements are independent.

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill bananas, it can be inferred that Sam did not give Bill any other fruit, including grapes. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen oranges, then Sam didn't give her any other fruits, including grapes. This makes S2 entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
B  
Because S1 speaks about giving only bananas to Mary, while S2 talks about not giving bananas to Ellen. These are unrelated events, so they are independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
B  
Because S1 limits banana-giving to Bill alone, but S2 about Tom not receiving bananas is independent information. There's no direct link between those two people, so the statements are independent.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue oranges, then Sam did not give her any other fruits, including grapes. This means S2 is entailed by S1.
