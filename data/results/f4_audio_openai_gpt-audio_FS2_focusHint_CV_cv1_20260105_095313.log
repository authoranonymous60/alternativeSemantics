--- Attempt 1 for f4_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave apples only to Sue and no one else. S2 says Sam also gave apples to Rob, which contradicts the idea that Sue was the only recipient of apples.

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave apples only to Bill. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Mary apples, which is independent. It does not confirm or contradict the claim that Bill is the only one Sam gave apples to—S2 simply speaks about Mary.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave oranges only to Mary and no one else. S2 says Sam also gave Ellen oranges, which contradicts the first sentence’s restriction.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "APPLES," meaning Sam gave Ellen only apples (not other fruits). S2 says Sam didn’t give Tom apples, which is independent from S1. It does not confirm or contradict the focus on the kind of thing given to Ellen.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Rob and no one else. S2 says Sam also gave Rob oranges, which contradicts the idea that bananas were all that Rob got.

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Bill and no one else. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Bill grapes, and this is entailed. It aligns with the fact that Bill only got bananas, not anything else.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave oranges only to Ellen and no one else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes, which is entailed, as it supports that Ellen only received oranges.

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Mary. S2 says Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas, which is independent. It doesn’t affect or contradict the fact that only Mary got bananas.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Bill. S2 says Sam didn’t give Tom bananas, which is entailed, as bananas were only for Bill.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave oranges only to Sue and no one else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Sue grapes, which is entailed by S1. Sue received only oranges, not grapes.
