You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave Tom APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.
B
Because...

9
S1: Sam only gave Sue BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.

--- Raw Model Output ---

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL" which means Sam gave only Bill bananas and no one else. However, S2 says Sam also gave Bill grapes, which contradicts the notion that bananas were the only thing Bill got.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY" which means Sam gave apples only to Mary and no one else. However, S2 says he also gave apples to Ellen, which contradicts the exclusivity implied by S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE" which means Sam gave apples only to Sue and no one else. S2 states that Tom also got apples, which contradicts the exclusivity implied in S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "GRAPES", meaning that Sam gave only grapes to Bill and nothing else. S2 confirms that Bill didn’t get oranges, which supports the proposition of S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "APPLES", meaning Bill only received apples and nothing else from Sam. S2 supports this by saying Bill didn’t receive bananas, which is consistent.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "APPLES", meaning Sue only received apples and nothing else. S2 supports this by stating Sue didn’t get bananas, which aligns with the exclusivity implied in S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN" which means Ellen is the only recipient of oranges. S2, which is about Tom not getting oranges, is independent of S1 since S1 only limits the recipient of oranges to Ellen.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM", meaning only Tom received apples. S2 confirms that Mary did not receive apples, which supports the exclusive focus implied in S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM", meaning only Tom received apples. S2 contradicts this by saying that Bill also received apples.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BANANAS", meaning Sue only received bananas, and no one else did. S2 supports this because it aligns with S1 by stating that Tom didn’t get bananas, confirming exclusivity.
