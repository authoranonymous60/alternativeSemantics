--- Attempt 1 for f3_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
B
Because S2 is independent of S1. S1 states who Sam gave grapes to, and S2 states who Sam did not give grapes to, but it is a different person.

1
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen apples.
C
Because S2 directly contradicts S1. S1 states that Sam gave Ellen apples, while S2 states that Sam did not give Ellen apples.

2
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
B
Because S2 is independent of S1. S1 states who Sam gave grapes to, and S2 states who Sam also gave grapes to, but it is a different person.

3
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.
B
Because S2 is independent of S1. S1 states who Sam gave apples to, and S2 states who Sam also gave apples to, but it is a different person.

4
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.
A
Because S1 implies that Sam only gave apples to Ellen, so it is entailed that Sam did not give apples to Bill.

5
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.
A
Because S1 implies that Sam only gave apples to Rob, so it is entailed that Sam did not give apples to Sue.

6
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.
B
Because S1 is about oranges and S2 is about apples.

7
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.
B
Because S1 is about apples and S2 is about grapes.

8
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.
A
Because S1 implies that Sam only gave bananas to Rob, so it is entailed that Sam did not give bananas to Ellen.

9
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.
B
Because S1 is about who Sam gave apples to, and S2 states who Sam also gave apples to, but it is a different person.
