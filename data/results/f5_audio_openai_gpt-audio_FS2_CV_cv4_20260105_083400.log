--- Attempt 1 for f5_cv4 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, then giving Ellen oranges contradicts that exclusivity, so S2 contradicts S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Ellen, then giving apples to Rob contradicts that exclusivity, so S2 contradicts S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave Mary ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary oranges, that implies no bananas were given to Mary, so S2 is entailed by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave TOM oranges.  
B  
Because the exclusivity in S1 is about Mary and oranges, it does not rule out giving oranges to someone else (Tom), so S2 is independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give TOM oranges.  
B  
Because S1 specifies exclusivity about Mary, but doesn’t specify anything about Tom. Whether or not Sam gave Tom oranges is not determined by S1, so S2 is independent.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary grapes, then giving Mary apples contradicts that exclusivity, so S2 contradicts S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave MARY apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Sue apples, then giving apples to Mary contradicts that exclusivity, so S2 contradicts S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Bill oranges, then giving Bill bananas contradicts that exclusivity, so S2 contradicts S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen bananas, then giving Ellen grapes contradicts that exclusivity, so S2 contradicts S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Tom BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom bananas, that implies no oranges were given to Tom, so S2 is entailed by S1.
