--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the first sentence focuses on Sue as the only recipient of apples, but the second sentence introduces another recipient, Rob, indicating independence.

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because focusing on Bill as the only recipient of apples entails that Mary was not a recipient.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the first sentence implies that Mary is the sole recipient of oranges, but the second sentence contradicts that by introducing another recipient, Ellen.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.  
A  
Because if Ellen is the only recipient of apples, it follows that Tom did not receive any.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
B  
Because giving Rob bananas only does not say anything about whether he got oranges; the two pieces of information are independent.

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because focusing on Bill as the only recipient of bananas entails that he did not receive grapes.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because if Ellen only received oranges, it follows that she did not receive grapes.

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if Mary is the only recipient of bananas, Ellen did not receive any.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because if only Bill received bananas, it follows that Tom did not.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because if Sue only received oranges, it entails that she did not receive grapes.
