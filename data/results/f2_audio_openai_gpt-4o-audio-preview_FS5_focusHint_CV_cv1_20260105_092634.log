--- Attempt 1 for f2_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave bananas to Rob and no one else. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam didn’t give bananas to Tom or anyone else.

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "TOM," meaning Sam gave grapes to Tom and no one else. This doesn’t specify what else Tom may have received, but since it focuses on grapes to Tom only, it implies that grapes—not oranges—were given to Tom.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "SUE," meaning Sam only gave oranges to Sue and not to anyone else. The second sentence contradicts this by saying Sue also got apples, which violates the exclusivity implied by “only” in S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave bananas exclusively to Sue and no one else. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam did not give bananas to Rob.

4  
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "TOM," meaning Sam gave oranges to Tom and no one else. This means Tom did not receive anything else, including bananas. So the sentences are entailed.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave apples to Sue and no one else. That means Sue didn’t get any other kind of fruit, including oranges.

6  
S1: Sam only gave Sue GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "GRAPES," meaning Sue only received grapes and nothing else. Therefore, it is entailed that Sue didn’t receive apples.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave oranges exclusively to Ellen. That excludes that Ellen received anything else, so the claim that Ellen also got bananas is a contradiction.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on "MARY," meaning Mary exclusively got grapes. While we know Mary didn’t get anything else but grapes, that doesn’t directly speak to whether she got apples specifically. The independence of focus makes the statements independent.

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave oranges only to Bill and no one else. Therefore, the statement that Mary also got oranges contradicts this.
