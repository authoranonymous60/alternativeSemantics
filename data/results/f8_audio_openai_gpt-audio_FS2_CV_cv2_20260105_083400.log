--- Attempt 1 for f8_cv2 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because S1 says that Ellen was the only recipient of bananas, but S2 says that Rob also received bananas, which contradicts the exclusivity expressed in S1.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
B  
Because S1 talks about grapes being given to Rob exclusively, but S2 introduces a new kind of fruit (oranges) without conflicting with the core claim about grapes. They’re independent statements.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because S1 says Tom was the only one who got apples, while S2 says Bill also received apples, contradicting the exclusivity of the recipient in S1.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because S1 asserts that apples were the only thing given to Mary, whereas S2 says something additional (bananas) was given to her, which contradicts the exclusivity implied in S1.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
B  
Because S1 says the type of fruit given to Ellen was oranges exclusively, while S2 introduces a different recipient (Sue) without contradicting the kind of fruit given to Ellen. The two sentences are independent.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because if Rob only got oranges, it is entailed that he didn’t get any other fruit, including apples. The second sentence follows naturally from the first.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because S1 says Bill was the only recipient of bananas. Therefore, it logically follows that Ellen did not receive bananas. S2 is entailed by S1.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
C  
Because S1 says that Rob was the only person to receive bananas, while S2 claims Sue also received bananas. This contradicts the exclusivity expressed in S1.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because S1 says that Bill was the only recipient of bananas. Therefore, it is entailed that Mary did not receive bananas.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because S1 says Ellen was the exclusive recipient of grapes. Therefore, it is entailed that Rob did not receive grapes.
