--- Attempt 1 for f3_cv4 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave grapes to Ellen, it entails that no one else, including Tom, received grapes.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Ellen, it contradicts the statement that Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave grapes to Rob, it contradicts the statement that Sam also gave grapes to Ellen.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Rob, it contradicts the statement that Sam also gave apples to Ellen.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Ellen, it entails that no one else, including Bill, received apples.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Rob, it entails that no one else, including Sue, received apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the focus on "oranges" doesn't exclude Sam giving Rob other fruits like apples, so the two statements are independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Rob, it contradicts the statement that he also gave Rob grapes.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave bananas to Rob, it entails that no one else, including Ellen, received bananas.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Mary, it contradicts the statement that he also gave apples to Ellen.
