--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
B  
Because the first sentence states that Tom only received apples, but the second sentence says he also got grapes. This adds new information that was not in the scope of the first sentence, making them independent of each other.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
B  
Because the first sentence talks about Mary and what she received, while the second sentence talks about Bill and what he did not receive. These two statements are about different people, so they are independent.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the first sentence says Mary only received apples, but the second sentence says she also got bananas. This contradicts the first sentence.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
B  
Because the first sentence focuses on Sue receiving apples, while the second sentence is about Rob not receiving apples. They are discussing different individuals, so the statements are independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because the first sentence says Bill only received bananas, but the second sentence says he also got grapes, which contradicts the first sentence.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
A  
Because if Rob only received grapes, it follows logically that he did not receive apples, so the second sentence is entailed by the first.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
B  
Because the first sentence says Sue only got grapes, but the second sentence talks about Tom. These are different individuals, so the sentences are independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the first sentence is about Ellen and her receiving grapes, and the second is about Rob not receiving grapes. They involve different people, so the statements are independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the first sentence says Mary only received grapes, but the second sentence says she also received bananas, which directly contradicts the first sentence.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
B  
Because the first sentence is about Sue receiving apples, while the second is about Bill not receiving apples. They discuss different people, making the statements independent.
