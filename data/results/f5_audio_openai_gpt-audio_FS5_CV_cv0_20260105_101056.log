--- Attempt 1 for f5_cv0 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave Mary GRAPES.
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.
C
Because if Sam only gave Mary grapes, then giving her apples contradicts the exclusivity implied by "only." 

1
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.
B
Because the statements concern different individuals (Sue vs. Mary), so the giving of apples to Mary is independent of giving apples only to Sue.

2
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.
C
Because if Sam only gave Bill oranges, giving him bananas contradicts the exclusivity implied by "only."

3
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
C
Because if Sam only gave Ellen bananas, giving her grapes contradicts the exclusivity implied by "only."

4
S1: Sam only gave TOM BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.
A
Because if Sam only gave Tom bananas, it is entailed that he didn’t give Tom oranges or anything else.

5
S1: Sam only gave MARY APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.
B
Because the statement about Mary does not say anything about Sue, so the giving of apples to Sue is independent of the giving to Mary.

6
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.
C
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, giving him apples contradicts the exclusivity implied by "only."

7
S1: Sam only gave LISA GRAPES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Lisa oranges.
A
Because if Sam only gave Lisa grapes, it is entailed that he didn’t give Lisa oranges or anything else.

8
S1: Sam only gave JAKE BANANAS.
S2: Sam also gave Jake bananas.
A
Because if Sam only gave Jake bananas, giving him bananas again or mentioning it aligns with that statement—it doesn’t contradict or add anything new.

9
S1: Sam only gave KAREN APPLES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Karen pears.
A
Because if Sam only gave Karen apples, it is entailed that he didn’t give her pears or anything else.
