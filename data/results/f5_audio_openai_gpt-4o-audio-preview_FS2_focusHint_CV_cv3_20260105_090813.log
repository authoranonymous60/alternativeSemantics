You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave grapes to Ellen and no one else. S2 says Sam also gave oranges to Ellen, which contradicts the idea that only grapes were given to her (since the focus is person-based, not item-based).

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave apples only to Ellen and no one else. S2 claims Sam also gave apples to Rob, which contradicts the first sentence.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave oranges to Mary and no one else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Mary bananas, which is consistent with S1 because S1 doesn’t claim he gave other things.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam only gave oranges to Mary, and nothing else to Mary. S2 is about giving oranges to Tom, which is independent of the restriction about Mary.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam only gave oranges to Mary. S2 mentions Tom and doesn’t contradict or depend on this restriction about Mary.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave grapes to Mary and nothing else. S2 says Sam also gave Mary apples, which contradicts the focus on exclusivity to grapes.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave apples to Sue and no one else. S2 says he also gave apples to Mary, which contradicts the first sentence.

7  
S1: Sam only gave Bill ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam gave only oranges to Bill and nothing else to Bill. S2 says Sam also gave Bill bananas, which contradicts the first sentence.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Ellen and no one else. S2 says he also gave her grapes, which contradicts the exclusivity implied by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM," meaning Sam gave bananas to Tom and no one else. S2 says he didn’t give Tom oranges, which is consistent with the exclusivity of the first sentence.
