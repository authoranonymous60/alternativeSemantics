You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Your output must follow this structure:

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

--- Raw Model Output ---

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give TOM bananas.  
C  
Because S1 says Rob was the only recipient of bananas, so if Tom didn’t receive bananas, that’s consistent, but the focus on Rob (“only ROB”) contrasts with possible other recipients like Tom. Thus, S2 is independently true but not required directly by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give TOM oranges.  
C  
Because S1 emphasizes that Tom only received grapes, so indicating he received no oranges (as in S2) reinforces the restriction in S1. But S2 is more specific than necessary to infer from S1, so it’s not strictly entailed.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave SUE apples.  
C  
Because S1 says Sue received only oranges, but S2 contradicts that by saying she also got apples. Hence, these statements directly contradict each other.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give ROB bananas.  
B  
Because S1 speaks about Sue being the only recipient of bananas, but S2 says something about what Rob didn’t receive. These statements don’t directly relate and can be considered independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give TOM bananas.  
A  
Because if Tom only got oranges, it necessarily entails that he didn’t get bananas. S2 is fully entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give SUE oranges.  
A  
Because if Sue only received apples, it logically follows that she did not receive oranges. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give SUE apples.  
A  
Because if Sue only received grapes, then it must be true that she didn’t get apples. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave ELLEN bananas.  
C  
Because S1 claims that Ellen only got oranges, while S2 says she also got bananas. This creates a direct contradiction.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give MARY apples.  
A  
Because if Mary only received grapes, it necessarily follows that she didn't get apples. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave MARY oranges.  
B  
Because S1 is about what Bill received, while S2 is about Mary. These statements don’t directly relate to each other and are independent.
