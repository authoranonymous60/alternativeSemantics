--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Tom APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Tom apples, it contradicts the idea that he also gave Tom grapes.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Mary BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
B  
Because the statement about what Sam gave Mary doesn't entail or contradict what he gave Bill.

2  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, he couldn't have also given her bananas.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Sue APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
B  
Because what Sam gave Sue doesn’t relate to what he gave Rob, so these are independent statements.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Bill bananas, then he could not have given him grapes as well.

5  
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, it follows that he didn’t give Rob apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave Sue GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
B  
Because what Sam gave Sue doesn’t determine what he gave Tom, so these are independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
B  
Because what Sam gave Ellen doesn’t entail or contradict what he gave Rob; the statements are about different people.

8  
S1: Sam only gave Mary GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary grapes, then he could not have also given her bananas.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Sue APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
B  
Because what Sam gave Sue doesn’t affect what he gave Bill; these statements are independent.
