--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, it follows that Sam didn’t give Rob apples.

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
B  
Because S1 specifies what Bill received, not what Ellen received. Ellen’s case is not entailed by S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
C  
Because S1 says Rob is the only recipient of bananas, while S2 claims Sue also got bananas, which contradicts S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill bananas, it means no one else, including Mary, got bananas.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, then Rob couldn’t have received grapes.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because S1 says Rob is the only recipient of oranges, while S2 introduces another recipient, Ellen, contradicting S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill apples, then Rob didn’t get apples.

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because if Mary is the only recipient of grapes, then Sue didn’t receive any grapes.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because S1 states that Rob is the sole recipient of grapes, while S2 says Bill also got grapes, which contradicts S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because if Ellen is the only recipient of oranges, it entails that Sue didn’t get oranges.
