You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
B  
Because the second sentence says Sam gave bananas to Rob, which is independent of S1 since S1 focuses on Ellen only receiving bananas, but it doesn't exclude the possibility that Rob also got bananas.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
B  
Because S1 marks that grapes were given only to Rob, but S2 talks about another type of fruit (oranges), which is outside the scope of S1. So they are independent.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because S1 says only Tom got apples, which means no one else got apples. S2 contradicts that by saying Bill also got apples.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because S1 asserts that apples were the only thing given to Mary. S2 contradicts this by saying that bananas were also given to Mary. 

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
B  
Because S1 claims that oranges were only given to Ellen. S2 doesn't focus on Ellen and introduces Sue also receiving oranges. This is independent information. 

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because S1 says Rob only got oranges, which implies he didn’t get apples. S2 says outright that Rob didn’t get apples. This is entailed. 

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if only Bill got bananas, then it follows that Ellen didn’t get bananas. S2 is entailed by S1. 

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
C  
Because S1 says that bananas only went to Rob. S2 contradicts this by saying Sue also got bananas. 

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because S1 states that bananas went only to Bill, so Mary couldn’t have received bananas. S2 is entailed by S1. 

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because S1 says only Ellen got grapes, implying that Rob didn’t get any grapes. S2 is entailed by S1.
