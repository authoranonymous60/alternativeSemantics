--- Attempt 1 for f5_cv2 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.
C
Because the focus in S1 is that Ellen received only grapes, but S2 states that Ellen also received oranges, which contradicts the exclusivity suggested by "only."

1
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.
S2: Sam also gave ROB apples.
B
Because S1 limits the recipient of apples to Ellen, while S2 adds a separate recipient, Rob. These statements don’t contradict each other but describe independent events.

2
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.
A
Because if Sam only gave Mary oranges, it follows that he didn’t give Mary any other fruit, including bananas, so S2 is entailed by S1.

3
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.
S2: Sam also gave TOM oranges.
B
Because S1 focuses on what Mary received, while S2 introduces what Tom received, presenting independent information regarding different recipients.

4
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.
S2: Sam didn’t give TOM oranges.
A
Because if Sam only gave Mary oranges, then he didn’t give oranges to anyone else, including Tom. So, S2 is entailed by S1.

5
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.
C
Because S1 limits what Mary received to only grapes, while S2 states that she also got apples. This directly contradicts the exclusivity in S1.

6
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam also gave MARY apples.
B
Because S1 focuses on Sue as the sole recipient of apples, while S2 talks about Mary getting apples as well. This describes independent distributions; it doesn’t necessarily contradict S1 but rather presents separate details.

7
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.
C
Because S1 says Bill only got oranges, and S2 says Bill got bananas as well. This directly contradicts the exclusivity implied in S1.

8
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
C
Because S1 states that Ellen solely received bananas, while S2 adds that she got grapes as well, which contradicts the exclusivity of S1.

9
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.
A
Because if Tom only received bananas, then he didn’t receive other fruits like oranges. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.
