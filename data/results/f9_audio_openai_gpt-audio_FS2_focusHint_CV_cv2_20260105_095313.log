--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
C
Because the prosodic focus on "ELLEN" in S1 means Sam did not give bananas to anyone other than Ellen. This does not restrict what was given to Ellen. S2 says Sam also gave Ellen grapes, which contradicts the meaning of "only gave Ellen bananas," because that would mean she got only bananas and nothing else.

1
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Mary oranges.
A
Because the prosodic focus on "MARY" means Sam didn’t give anyone else apples. It does not mean Mary got other items, only that no one else got apples. S2 says Sam didn’t give Mary oranges, which is consistent with S1. There is no contradiction. It is entailed that if Sam only gave Mary apples, this does not conflict with not giving her oranges.

2
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.
C
Because the prosodic focus on "TOM" means the restriction is on who received bananas—only Tom. The sentence does not restrict what Tom received. S2 says Sam also gave Tom apples. This contradicts the meaning if the focus were on "bananas" (only bananas), but here the focus is on "TOM." Therefore, it contradicts the interpretation that Tom only got bananas and nothing else. The intended meaning matched a restriction on who got bananas, not what Tom got. But S2 directly contradicts the interpretation involving what Tom received when based on the common reading. Thus, the classification is contradiction.

3
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Mary grapes.
A
Because the prosodic focus on "MARY" means the restriction is on the receiver of apples—only Mary got apples. It does not say anything about other items Mary might have gotten. S2 states Sam didn’t give Mary grapes. This is fully consistent with S1. There is no contradiction; it follows from S1 that nothing prohibits Mary from not getting grapes. It is entailed that Mary didn’t get other things, and it’s fully consistent. Therefore, it is entailed.

4
S1: Sam only gave MARY ORANGES.
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.
A
Because the prosodic focus is on "ORANGES"—this means Mary got only oranges from Sam and not any other type of fruit from Sam. S2 says Sam didn’t give Mary apples. This fits perfectly with the restriction provided by the prosodic focus in S1. Therefore, it is entailed.

5
S1: Sam only gave ROB APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.
B
Because the prosodic focus is on "APPLES"—this means that apples were only given to Rob and no one else got apples. S2 says Sam also gave Mary apples. That is independent and does not follow from S1. There is no logical contradiction or entailment; S2 is independent.

6
S1: Sam only gave ROB APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave TOM apples.
C
Because the prosodic focus is on "APPLES"—this means that apples were only given to Rob and no one else got apples. S2 says Sam also gave Tom apples, which contradicts the meaning of S1. It conflicts directly with the restriction that only Rob received apples.

7
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.
A
Because the prosodic focus is on "ORANGES"—this means Rob got only oranges and not any other fruit. S2 says Sam didn’t give Rob bananas, which fits perfectly with the restriction in S1. It is entailed that Rob did not receive anything else besides oranges.

8
S1: Sam only gave BILL GRAPES.
S2: Sam also gave ROB grapes.
C
Because the prosodic focus is on "GRAPES"—this means grapes were only given to Bill and no one else got grapes. S2 says Sam also gave Rob grapes, which contradicts the restriction that only Bill received grapes. Therefore, it is a contradiction.

9
S1: Sam only gave ROB GRAPES.
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.
B
Because the prosodic focus is on "GRAPES"—this means that Rob only received grapes and did not get any other fruit (like bananas). S2 states Sam also gave Rob bananas, which deals with another type of fruit not mentioned or restricted in S1. It doesn’t contradict S1, but it’s not entailed either. Therefore, this is independent.
