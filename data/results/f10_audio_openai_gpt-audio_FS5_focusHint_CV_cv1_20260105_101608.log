You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.
A
Because the prosodic focus is on "TOM," meaning Sam didn't give apples to anyone else. Since S2 says Sam did not give Bill apples, it aligns with this restriction. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.
C
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "TOM," meaning Sam didn't give grapes to anyone else, but this does not restrict whether Tom got anything else. S2 says Sam also gave Tom apples, which contradicts any idea that Sam gave Tom only grapes and nothing else.

2
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.
A
Because the prosodic focus is on "MARY," meaning Sam didn't give bananas to anyone else. S2 states that Bill didn't receive bananas, which is consistent with this entailment.

3
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
C
Because the prosodic focus is on "MARY," meaning Sam didn't give apples to anyone else. However, this does not restrict what Mary received. S2 introduces that Mary also got bananas, which contradicts the meaning implied by "only" if it were meant to restrict Mary to just apples.

4
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam didn't give ROB apples.
A
Because the prosodic focus is on "SUE," meaning Sam didn't give apples to anyone besides Sue. S2 says Sam didn't give Rob apples, which supports the entailment.

5
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.
A
Because the prosodic focus is on "ROB," meaning Rob didn’t get anything else besides grapes. S2 confirms Rob didn’t get apples, which matches that entailment.

6
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.
C
Because the prosodic focus is on "SUE," meaning Sue was the only person to receive grapes. S2 says that Tom also received grapes, which contradicts this focus.

7
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.
A
Because the prosodic focus is on "ELLEN," meaning no one else received grapes aside from Ellen. S2 states that Rob didn’t get grapes, which aligns with this entailment.

8
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
B
Because the prosodic focus is on "MARY," meaning no one else got grapes other than Mary. However, this does not restrict what else Mary received. S2 says Mary also received bananas, which is independent of the original statement.

9
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.
A
Because the prosodic focus is on "SUE," meaning Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else. S2 states that Bill didn’t receive apples, which falls within the expected entailment.
