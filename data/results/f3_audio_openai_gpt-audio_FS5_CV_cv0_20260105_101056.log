You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, it means no one else, including Tom, received grapes. This entails that Sam didn't give Tom grapes.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen apples, it means apples were the only things given to Ellen, so no oranges were given, which entails that Sam didn’t give Ellen oranges.

2  
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
B  
Because saying Sam only gave Rob grapes means Rob was the exclusive recipient of grapes, while the second sentence says Ellen also received grapes. These statements are independent because one is specifying exclusivity around Rob, while the other is mentioning an additional recipient.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
B  
Because the first sentence restricts the giving of apples to only Rob, and the second says Ellen also got apples. Both statements are independent as they discuss different possible distributions, without direct logical contradiction.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
B  
Because the first sentence focuses on Ellen as the sole recipient of apples. The second sentence says Bill didn’t receive apples. While these statements are consistent, they are independent since the second sentence doesn’t necessarily follow from the first, it’s just an additional fact.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, it means he didn’t give apples to anyone else, including Sue. Therefore, it entails that Sam didn’t give Sue apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the first sentence states that Rob exclusively received oranges (and no other items were given), while the second says Rob also received apples. This contradicts the exclusivity implied by the first sentence.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the first sentence states Rob exclusively received apples. The second sentence says Rob also received grapes. This directly contradicts the exclusivity claim of the first sentence.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob bananas, it follows naturally that Ellen didn’t get any bananas. So the second sentence is entailed by the first.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the first sentence says that Mary was the exclusive recipient of apples. The second sentence says Ellen also received apples. This directly contradicts the exclusivity claim in the first sentence.
