You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus on "TOM" in S1 means Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else, but S2 says Sam gave Tom something else (grapes), which contradicts the focus that only apples were given to Tom.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus on "TOM" in S1 means no one else received grapes. S2, stating that Bill didn’t get grapes, is consistent with that and thus is entailed.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus on "MARY" in S1 means no one else received bananas. S2, stating that Bill didn’t get bananas, logically follows from that and is entailed.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus on "MARY" in S1 means Mary didn’t get anything else but apples. S2 says Mary got bananas too, which contradicts S1.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus on "SUE" in S1 means no one else received apples. S2, saying Rob didn’t get apples, follows from that and is entailed.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus on "BILL" in S1 means Bill didn’t receive anything else but bananas. S2 says Bill got grapes too, which contradicts S1.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus on "SUE" in S1 means no one else got grapes. S2 says Tom got grapes too, which contradicts the claim in S1.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus on "ELLEN" in S1 means no one else received grapes. S2, stating Rob didn’t get grapes, is entailed by S1.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus on "GRAPES" in S1 means Mary didn’t get anything other than grapes. S2 says Mary got bananas too, which contradicts S1.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus on "SUE" in S1 means no one else received apples. S2 states Bill didn’t get apples, which is entailed by the focus in S1.
