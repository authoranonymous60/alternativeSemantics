   C = contradicted.

--- Raw Model Output ---

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the first sentence states that Ellen only received grapes, but the second sentence states she also received oranges, which contradicts the first.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the second sentence talks about Rob, who is not mentioned in the first sentence, so the two statements are independent.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because if Mary only received oranges, it implies she didn’t receive bananas, so the second sentence is entailed by the first.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the first sentence focuses on what Mary received, while the second sentence focuses on Tom, so they are independent statements.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the first sentence only talks about Mary’s oranges, and doesn’t mention Tom, so the second sentence is independent.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the first sentence restricts Mary’s gifts to only grapes, but the second sentence mentions apples, which contradicts the first.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because the focus in the first sentence is on Sue, and the second is on Mary. The information about Mary is independent of the information about Sue.

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because the first sentence says Bill only received oranges, but the second says he also received bananas, which contradicts the first.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the first sentence limits Ellen to receiving only bananas, but the second sentence adds grapes, which contradicts the first.

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because if Tom only received bananas, it implies he did not receive oranges, so the second sentence is entailed by the first.
