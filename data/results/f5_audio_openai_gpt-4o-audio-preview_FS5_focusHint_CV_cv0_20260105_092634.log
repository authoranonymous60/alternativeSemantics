--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Mary GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus is on "GRAPES," meaning Sam did not give Mary anything else. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave her apples.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because the focus is on "SUE,” meaning Sam did not give apples to anyone else. S2 talks about giving apples to Mary, which is independent of the statement about Sue.

2  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because the focus is on "oranges," meaning Sam did not give Bill anything else. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave Bill bananas.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam did not give bananas to anyone else. However, S2 talks about giving Ellen grapes, which contradicts the idea that she only received bananas.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Tom BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the focus is on "BANANAS," meaning Sam didn’t give Tom anything else. S2 supports this by confirming Sam didn’t give Tom oranges, so the two are entailed.

5  
S1: Sam only gave JOHN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave John apples.  
C  
Because the focus is on "oranges," meaning Sam did not give John anything else. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave John apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave LISA grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Lisa bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on "grapes," meaning Sam didn’t give her anything else. S2 confirms this by stating that Sam didn’t give Lisa bananas, so it’s entailed.

7  
S1: Sam only gave PAUL apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because the focus is on "PAUL," meaning Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else. However, S2 talks about Mary receiving apples, which makes it independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave Anna BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Anna oranges.  
C  
Because the focus is on "BANANAS," meaning Sam didn’t give her anything else. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave Anna oranges.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROBERT apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Robert oranges.  
A  
Because the focus is on "apples," meaning Sam didn’t give Robert anything else. S2 confirms this by saying Sam didn’t give him oranges, so it’s entailed.
