You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because by focusing on "BILL," S1 states that Bill was the only recipient of bananas. S2 contradicts this by suggesting another type of fruit, grapes, was also given to Bill, violating the exclusivity in S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because in S1, the focus on "MARY" means Mary is the only person who received apples. S2 contradicts that by saying Ellen also received apples, violating the exclusivity.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because with the focus on "SUE," S1 states that Sue was the only person who received apples. S2 contradicts this by stating that Tom also received apples.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because by focusing on "BILL," S1 means Bill was the only recipient of grapes. This doesn't conflict with S2, which just clarifies what Bill didn’t receive, so the statements are independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because with the focus on "BILL," S1 means Bill was the only one who received apples. S2 indicates Bill didn't get bananas, which is consistent with S1, as it just specifies what Bill didn’t receive.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because in S1, by focusing on "SUE," it means that Sue was the only one who received apples. S2 just says Sue didn’t get bananas, so there’s no contradiction, and both are consistent.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because S1, focusing on "ELLEN," means that Ellen was the only recipient of oranges. S2 supports that by saying Tom didn’t receive any oranges, consistent with the exclusivity stated in S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because with the focus on "TOM," S1 means Tom was the only person who got apples. S2, saying Mary didn’t receive apples, supports this and is consistent with S1's exclusivity.

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because S1, by focusing on "TOM," says Tom was the only one who received apples. S2 contradicts this by saying Bill also received apples, violating the exclusivity.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because with the focus on "SUE," S1 means Sue was the only one who received bananas. S2, stating that Tom didn’t get bananas, is consistent with that exclusivity.
