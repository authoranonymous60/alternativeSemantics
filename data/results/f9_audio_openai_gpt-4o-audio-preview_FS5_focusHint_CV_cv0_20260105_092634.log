--- Attempt 1 for f9_cv0 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else besides Rob. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave apples to Mary.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else except Rob. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave apples to Tom.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam didn’t give anything else to Rob besides oranges. S2 is entailed from this, as it confirms Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam didn’t give grapes to anyone else except Bill. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave grapes to Rob.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "GRAPES," meaning Sam didn’t give Rob anything else besides grapes. S2 is independent, since giving Rob bananas is a different kind of action that isn’t ruled out by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else besides Rob. S2 contradicts S1 by saying Sam also gave apples to Mary.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else besides Rob. S2 contradicts this by stating Sam also gave apples to Tom.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam didn’t give anything else to Rob. S2 is entailed as it confirms Sam didn’t give Rob bananas, which is consistent with S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam didn’t give grapes to anyone else except Bill. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave grapes to Rob.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "GRAPES," meaning Sam didn’t give Rob anything else besides grapes. S2 is independent because giving Rob bananas is a separate action that S1 doesn’t address directly.
