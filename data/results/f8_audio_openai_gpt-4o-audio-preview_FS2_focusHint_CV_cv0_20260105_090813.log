You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on bananas, meaning Sam didn’t give anything else to Ellen. S2 talks about giving bananas to Rob, which doesn’t contradict or rely on the claim about Ellen. They are about independent people, so the sentences are independent.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
B  
Because the focus is on Rob in S1, meaning Sam didn’t give grapes to anyone else. S2 talks about giving something else (oranges) to Rob, which doesn’t contradict or entail the claim about grapes. Therefore, they are independent.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because the focus is on Tom, this means Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else. S2 says that he gave apples to Bill, which contradicts the first statement.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the focus is on apples, it means that Sam didn’t give Mary anything else. S2 says he also gave Mary bananas, which contradicts the claim in S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
B  
Because the focus is on oranges, meaning he didn’t give Ellen any other fruit. The fact that he gave oranges to Sue doesn’t contradict or depend on the statement about Ellen, so they are independent.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the focus is on Rob, meaning Sam didn’t give oranges to anyone else. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Rob apples, which aligns with the notion that oranges are the only thing Rob got, so this is entailed.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on Bill, meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else. S2 supports that by saying Ellen did not get bananas, so this is entailed.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
C  
Because the focus is on Rob, meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else. S2 says Sue also got bananas, which contradicts that statement.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on Bill, meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else. Saying that Mary didn’t get bananas is consistent with that restriction, so it’s entailed.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on grapes, meaning Sam didn’t give Ellen anything but grapes. It also implies that grapes went only to Ellen, so the statement that Rob didn’t get grapes follows from that and is entailed.
