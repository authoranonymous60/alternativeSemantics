--- Attempt 1 for f4_cv0 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning no one else received apples. S2 contradicts that by claiming Rob also got apples.

1
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.
B
Because S1 is specifically about Bill, while S2 talks about Mary. There is no direct entailment or contradiction between these statements.

2
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.
C
Because S1 focuses on "MARY," meaning no one else received oranges. S2 contradicts that by stating Ellen also got oranges.

3
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.
B
Because S1 is about Ellen getting apples, while S2 concerns Tom. There is no direct entailment or contradiction.

4
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.
B
Because S1 focuses on Rob receiving only bananas, but S2 introduces a different fruit (oranges). The statements talk about different items, so they are independent.

5
S1: Sam only gave BILL BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill grapes.
A
Because if Sam only gave Bill bananas, that entails that Bill did not receive other fruits, such as grapes. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

6
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN ORANGES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.
A
Because if Ellen only received oranges, she must not have received grapes. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

7
S1: Sam only gave MARY BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.
B
Because S1 is about Mary receiving bananas, while S2 is about whether Ellen received bananas. These statements concern different people, so they are independent.

8
S1: Sam only gave BILL BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.
B
Because S1 is about Bill receiving bananas, and S2 is about Tom. There is no direct entailment or contradiction.

9
S1: Sam only gave SUE ORANGES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.
A
Because if Sue only received oranges, that implies she didn’t receive grapes. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.
