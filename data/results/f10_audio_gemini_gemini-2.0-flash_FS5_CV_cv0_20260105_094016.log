--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.
C
Because... S1 states that Sam only gave Tom apples, but S2 states that Sam also gave Tom grapes, which contradicts the exclusivity of S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.

Because... S1 is about what Sam gave Mary, and S2 is about what Sam didn't give Bill. These are independent events.

2
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
B
Because... S1 is about what Sam gave only to Mary, and S2 introduces a new item given to Mary, which doesn't contradict S1 but is independent.

3
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.
A
Because... S1 states that Sam only gave Sue apples, implying that no one else received apples. S2 confirms that Rob didn't receive apples, which is consistent with S1.

4
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.
