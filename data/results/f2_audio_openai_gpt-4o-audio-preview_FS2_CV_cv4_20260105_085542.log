--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because by saying Sam only gave ROB bananas, it excludes giving bananas to anyone else, including Tom. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because by stating Sam only gave TOM grapes, it implies Tom did not receive any other fruit, including oranges. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because S1 claims Sue only received oranges, while S2 says she also got apples. These statements contradict each other.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because "only giving Sue bananas" means no one else received bananas, so S2 is entailed by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because "only giving Tom oranges" means Tom didn't receive any other fruit, including bananas. S2 is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because "only giving Sue apples" implies she did not receive oranges or any other fruit. S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sue only got grapes, she didn’t get apples or any other fruit. S2 is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because if Ellen only got oranges, she couldn’t have received bananas too. S2 contradicts S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because "only giving Mary grapes" means she didn’t receive apples or any other fruit. S2 is entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
B  
Because S1 talks about Bill’s fruit, while S2 talks about Mary’s fruit, and they don’t depend on each other. The statements are independent.
