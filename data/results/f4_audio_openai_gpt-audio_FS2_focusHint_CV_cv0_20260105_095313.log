You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning that Sam did not give apples to anyone else except Sue. S2 says Sam also gave Rob apples, which directly contradicts the inference of S1.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave Bill APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "APPLES," meaning that Bill didn’t get anything other than apples. S2 is about Mary, and it doesn't confirm or contradict whether Bill only got apples. It is an independent statement.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam didn’t give oranges to anyone else except Mary. S2 says Sam also gave Ellen oranges, which directly contradicts the exclusivity implied in S1.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning that Ellen was the only one who received apples. S2, which is about Tom and whether he got apples, does not affect the exclusivity claim about Ellen, so it’s independent.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BANANAS," meaning that bananas were the only thing Rob received. S2 says Rob also got oranges, which directly contradicts the exclusivity about what was given to Rob in S1.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BANANAS," meaning that Bill only received bananas and nothing else. S2 says Bill didn’t get grapes, which supports this because it aligns with the claim that bananas were the only thing given to Bill.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning that oranges were the only thing Ellen received. S2 confirms that Ellen didn’t get grapes, which supports the exclusive claim in S1.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Mary was the only one who got bananas. S2 is about Ellen not getting bananas. It doesn’t confirm or contradict whether Mary was the only recipient. The statement about Ellen’s situation is independent.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Bill was the only person to get bananas. S2 says Tom didn’t get bananas, which does not confirm or contradict whether Bill was the only recipient. So S2 is independent.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning oranges were the only thing Sue got. S2 says Sue didn’t get grapes, which aligns with and supports the inference that she got only oranges.
