--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave Ellen BANANAS.
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.
B
Because the prosodic focus on "BANANAS" in S1 suggests a restriction on what was given to Ellen. S2 discusses Rob, who is not mentioned in S1, making the statements independent.

1
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.
B
Because the focus in S1 is on the recipient "ROB" with grapes, whereas S2 introduces oranges, which is a different item, making the statements independent.

2
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.
B
Because S1 restricts the giving of apples to Tom, while S2 discusses apples given to Bill. The different recipients make the statements independent.

3
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
C
Because S1 restricts that Mary only received apples. S2 contradicts this by saying Mary also received bananas.

4
S1: Sam only gave Ellen ORANGES.
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.
B
Because the focus is on Ellen receiving only oranges. S2 introduces another person, Sue, making the statements independent of each other.

5
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.
A
Because if Rob only received oranges, then it is entailed that he did not receive apples.

6
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.
B
Because S1 focuses on Bill receiving only bananas, while S2 talks about Ellen not receiving bananas. These statements are independent.

7
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.
C
Because S1 restricts that only Rob got bananas, but S2 claims that Sue also received bananas, contradicting the restriction in S1.

8
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.
B
Because S1 talks about Bill receiving bananas, while S2 talks about Mary not receiving bananas. These two statements are independent in terms of recipients.

9
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.
A
Because if Ellen is the only one who received grapes, then it naturally follows that Rob did not receive grapes.
