--- Attempt 1 for f10 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Understood. I can help with that. You will need to provide or let me access the audio files containing S1 and S2. Once I receive the audio for each S1 and S2 pair, I’ll transcribe it, mark the prosodic focus in S1 using uppercase, and classify S2 relative to S1.

Please provide the audio for the first S1 and S2 pair, and I can begin.

Understood. I’ll now proceed by taking the audio, extracting S1 and S2 from each segment, marking the prosodic focus in S1 using uppercase, and then classifying S2 relative to S1. I’ll follow the structure strictly as you indicated for all the provided segments. Please provide the audio file, and I will begin transcription.

Understood. I’ll call a function to process the audio and gather S1 and S2 so we can proceed with transcription, prosodic focus marking, and classification. Let's begin.

Please provide the audio sample containing S1 and S2 or let me access it so I can start.
