You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because by focusing on "grapes," S1 means Sam gave Ellen only grapes and nothing else. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave Ellen oranges, which means he gave her more than just grapes.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because by focusing on "Ellen," S1 means that Ellen was the only one who received apples. S2 contradicts this by saying that Rob also received apples, so Ellen was not the only recipient.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because focusing on "Mary" means that Mary was the only person who got oranges. This is consistent with S2, which says Sam didn’t give Mary bananas. There’s no contradiction and the statements align logically.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
C  
Because focusing on "Mary" means that Mary was the only one who got oranges. S2 contradicts this by saying Tom also got oranges, so Mary was not the only recipient.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because focusing on "Mary" means that Mary was the only person who got oranges. S2 aligns with this by saying Sam didn’t give Tom oranges, which supports that Mary is the sole recipient.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "grapes" means that grapes were the only thing Mary got. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave Mary apples, which means she got more than just grapes.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "Sue" means that Sue was the only person who got apples. S2 contradicts this by saying Mary also got apples, so Sue was not the only recipient.

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because focusing on "oranges" means that oranges were the only thing Bill got. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave Bill bananas, so Bill got something other than oranges.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because focusing on "bananas" means that bananas were the only thing Ellen got. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave Ellen grapes, which means she got more than just bananas.

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because focusing on "bananas" means that bananas were the only thing Tom got. S2 aligns with this by saying Sam didn’t give Tom oranges, which supports the claim that bananas were the only thing he received.
