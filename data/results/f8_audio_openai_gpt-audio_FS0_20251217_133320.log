You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

7

8

9

Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference.  You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.

0  
S1: Sam ONLY gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB bananas.  
C  
Because focusing on "ELLEN" in S1 means Sam did not give bananas to anyone else. S2 says Sam gave bananas to Rob, which contradicts this.  

1  
S1: Sam ONLY gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB oranges.  
C  
Because focusing on "grapes" in S1 means Sam did not give Rob anything other than grapes. S2 says Sam gave Rob oranges, which contradicts this.  

2  
S1: Sam ONLY gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave BILL apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "TOM" in S1 means Sam did not give apples to anyone else. S2 says Sam gave apples to Bill, which contradicts this.  

3  
S1: Sam ONLY gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave MARY bananas.  
C  
Because focusing on "apples" in S1 means Sam did not give Mary anything other than apples. S2 says Sam gave Mary bananas, which contradicts this.  

4  
S1: Sam ONLY gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave SUE oranges.  
C  
Because focusing on "ELLEN" in S1 means Sam did not give oranges to anyone else. S2 says Sam gave oranges to Sue, which contradicts this.  

5  
S1: Sam ONLY gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ROB apples.  
A  
Because focusing on "oranges" in S1 means Sam did not give Rob anything other than oranges. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Rob apples, which is consistent with S1.  

6  
S1: Sam ONLY gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ELLEN bananas.  
A  
Because focusing on "BILL" in S1 means Sam did not give bananas to anyone else. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas, which is consistent with S1.  

7  
S1: Sam ONLY gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave SUE bananas.  
C  
Because focusing on "ROB" in S1 means Sam did not give bananas to anyone else. S2 says Sam gave bananas to Sue, which contradicts this.  

8  
S1: Sam ONLY gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give MARY bananas.  
A  
Because focusing on "BILL" in S1 means Sam did not give bananas to anyone else. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Mary bananas, which is consistent with S1.  

9  
S1: Sam ONLY gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ROB grapes.  
A  
Because focusing on "ELLEN" in S1 means Sam did not give grapes to anyone else. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Rob grapes, which is consistent with S1.
