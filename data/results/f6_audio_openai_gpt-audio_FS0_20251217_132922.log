You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

0  
S1: SAM only gave ROB apples.  
S2: SAM didn't give SUE apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, that implies Sam didn't give apples to anyone else, including Sue.

1  
S1: SAM only gave SUE GRAPES.  
S2: SAM also gave SUE oranges.  
C  
Because saying Sam only gave Sue grapes means oranges would contradict this exclusivity—grapes are the only thing mentioned.

2  
S1: SAM only gave SUE GRAPES.  
S2: SAM didn't give SUE bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue grapes, it implies no other fruits, including bananas.

3  
S1: SAM only gave MARY GRAPES.  
S2: SAM also gave ELLEN grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary grapes, giving the same to Ellen contradicts this exclusivity.

4  
S1: SAM only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: SAM also gave ROB bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, giving Rob bananas contradicts that exclusivity.

5  
S1: SAM only gave SUE BANANAS.  
S2: SAM didn't give SUE grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue bananas, that excludes other fruits like grapes.

6  
S1: SAM only gave TOM GRAPES.  
S2: SAM didn't give TOM apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom grapes, apples are excluded, so it's entailed that Tom didn't get apples.

7  
S1: SAM only gave TOM BANANAS.  
S2: SAM didn't give TOM grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom bananas, any other fruit such as grapes is excluded.

8  
S1: SAM only gave ROB APPLES.  
S2: SAM also gave ROB grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, giving him grapes contradicts that exclusivity.

9  
S1: SAM only gave ELLEN GRAPES.  
S2: SAM also gave ELLEN oranges.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, giving her oranges contradicts the exclusivity.
