0
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.
A
Because "only ROB" means only Rob received apples, so Sue did not.

1
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.
B
Because S1 restricts who got grapes (only Sue) but says nothing about what else Sue got; giving her oranges is neither entailed nor ruled out.

2
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.
B
Because S1 limits who received grapes, not whether Sue received bananas.

3
S1: Sam only gave Mary GRAPES.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
B
Because S1 says Mary received only grapes, not that others couldn’t also receive grapes.

4
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.
C
Because S1 says Rob received only oranges, while S2 says he also got bananas.

5
S1: Sam only gave Sue BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.
A
Because if Sue got only bananas, she did not get grapes.

6
S1: Sam only gave Tom GRAPES.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.
A
Because if Tom got only grapes, he did not get apples.

7
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
B
Because S1 restricts who got bananas (only Tom), not whether Tom received other fruits like grapes.

8
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.
C
Because S1 says Rob received only apples, while S2 says he also got grapes.

9
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.
B
Because S1 limits grapes to Ellen but doesn’t restrict what else Ellen received; she could also get oranges.
