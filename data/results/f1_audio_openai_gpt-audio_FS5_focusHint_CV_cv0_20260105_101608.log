--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam did not give grapes to anyone else besides Bill. S2 says Sam gave grapes to Sue as well, which directly contradicts the entailment of S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam did not give oranges to anyone else besides Sue. S2 says Sam also gave oranges to Rob, which contradicts the assertion in S1.

2
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave grapes only to Sue and no one else. S2 states that Sam did not give grapes to Ellen, which is fully consistent with S1’s entailment.

3
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
B
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM," meaning Sam gave apples only to Tom and no apples to anyone else. S2 talks about grapes, which is a different item, so the two sentences are independent.

4
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam gave Rob only oranges and nothing else. S2 says Sam also gave Rob apples, which contradicts the entailment of S1.

5
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave grapes only to Sue and no one else. S2 says that Sam didn’t give Tom grapes, which is consistent with that entailment.

6
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Ellen and not to anyone else. S2 says that Sam also gave bananas to Mary, which directly contradicts that.

7
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.
B
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Rob and no bananas to anyone else. S2 talks about oranges, not bananas, so it is independent of that entailment.

8
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Mary and nothing else. S2 says that Sam gave Mary apples as well, which contradicts the entailment.

9
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.
A
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave oranges only to Sue and no one else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Rob oranges, which matches that entailment exactly.
