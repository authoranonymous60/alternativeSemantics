--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, it follows that he didn't give grapes to someone else, like Tom.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen apples, it follows that he didn't give her anything else, including oranges.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, it contradicts the claim that he also gave grapes to Ellen.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, it contradicts the idea that someone else (Ellen) also got apples.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen apples, it follows that no one else, including Bill, got apples.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, it follows he didn't give apples to anyone else, including Sue.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because "Sam only gave Rob oranges" limits what Sam gave Rob to oranges, but doesn’t rule out the possibility of giving Rob apples separately. The focus is on the type of fruit limited in the context of oranges. This makes the second statement independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, it contradicts the idea that he also gave Rob grapes.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob bananas, it follows that he did not give bananas to anyone else, including Ellen.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, it contradicts the claim that he also gave apples to Ellen.
