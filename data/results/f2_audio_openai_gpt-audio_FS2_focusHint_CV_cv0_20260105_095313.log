You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ROB," which means Sam gave bananas to Rob and not to anyone else. S2, which states that Sam didn’t give Tom bananas, is consistent with this. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "TOM," which means Sam gave grapes to Tom and not to anyone else. This doesn't entail anything about what fruit Tom did or didn’t get besides grapes. S2, which states that Tom didn’t get oranges, is independent since S1 doesn’t say anything about oranges. 

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam gave Sue oranges and nothing else. If Sam also gave Sue apples, that contradicts S1. So S2 is contradicted by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Sue and not to anyone else. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Rob bananas, and this follows from S1, so S2 is entailed by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave TOM ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam gave Tom only oranges and nothing else. Therefore, if Sam gave Tom no other fruit, S2 (that Sam didn’t give Tom bananas) is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "APPLES," meaning Sam gave Sue only apples and nothing else. That means Sue didn’t get oranges, so S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "GRAPES," meaning Sam gave Sue only grapes and nothing else. Therefore, S2 (that Sam didn’t give Sue apples) follows from S1, and is entailed.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam gave Ellen only oranges and nothing else. If S2 says Sam also gave Ellen bananas, that contradicts S1. So S2 is contradicted by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "GRAPES," meaning Sam gave Mary only grapes and nothing else. Therefore, S2, which says Mary didn’t get apples, is entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave oranges only to Bill and not anyone else. S2 says Mary got oranges. It doesn’t follow from or contradict S1 (which only addressed Bill), so S2 is independent of S1.
