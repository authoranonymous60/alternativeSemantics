You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave grapes to Ellen and no one else. Therefore, it follows that Sam didn't give grapes to Tom, confirming that S2 is entailed by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "APPLES," meaning Sam gave Ellen apples and nothing else. Therefore, it follows that Sam didn’t give Ellen oranges, confirming that S2 is entailed by S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave grapes to Rob and no one else. Therefore, S2—that Sam also gave Ellen grapes—contradicts this, so S2 is contradicted by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave apples to Rob and no one else. Therefore, S2—that Sam also gave Ellen apples—contradicts this, so S2 is contradicted by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave apples to Ellen and no one else. Therefore, it follows that Sam didn’t give apples to Bill, confirming that S2 is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave apples to Rob and no one else. Therefore, it follows that Sam didn’t give apples to Sue, confirming that S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam gave Rob oranges and nothing else to Rob. S2 states that Sam also gave Rob apples, which talks about something different that wasn't restricted by S1. Thus, the two statements are independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "APPLES," meaning Sam gave Rob apples and nothing else to Rob. Therefore, S2—that Sam also gave Rob grapes—contradicts this, so S2 is contradicted by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave bananas to Rob and no one else. Therefore, it follows that Sam didn’t give bananas to Ellen, confirming that S2 is entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave apples to Mary and no one else. Therefore, S2—that Sam also gave Ellen apples—contradicts this, so S2 is contradicted by S1.
