--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Bill bananas, then it contradicts the idea that he also gave Bill grapes.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, it means apples were exclusively for Mary and thus conflicts with giving apples to Ellen as well.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because giving apples only to Sue means no one else should receive them, so giving apples to Tom contradicts that.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because if Bill only got grapes, it follows that he didn’t get oranges, so they are consistent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because if Bill only got apples, it means he got no other fruit, so he didn’t get bananas, making this entailed.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because if Sue only got apples, she didn’t get other fruits, so she must not have gotten bananas, thus they are consistent.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because if the oranges were exclusively given to Ellen, it’s entailed that Tom couldn’t have received any oranges.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if only Tom got apples, it naturally follows that Mary didn’t get any apples, so the second statement is consistent with the first.

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because if only Tom received apples, then giving apples to Bill as well contradicts that exclusivity.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because if Sue was the only recipient of bananas, then it follows that Tom didn’t get any bananas.
