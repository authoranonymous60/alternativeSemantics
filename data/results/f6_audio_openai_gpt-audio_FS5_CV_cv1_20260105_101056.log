--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
B  
Because the statement about Rob doesn't entail anything about Sue. They involve different individuals, so the relationship is independent.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because the first sentence says Sue only got grapes, but the second sentence contradicts it by saying she also got oranges.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because if Sue only got grapes, she didn't get any other fruit like bananas. The second sentence is entailed by the first.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
B  
Because the first sentence is about Mary, and the second is about Ellen. It doesn't logically follow or contradict—it’s independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the first sentence says Rob only got oranges, but the second contradicts that by saying he also got bananas.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because if Sue only got bananas, then she didn't get grapes. The second sentence is entailed by the first.

6  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
A  
Because if Tom only got grapes, then he didn’t get apples. The second sentence is entailed by the first.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Tom only got bananas, then he didn’t get grapes. The second sentence is entailed by the first.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the first sentence says Rob only got apples, and the second contradicts that by saying he also got grapes.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the first sentence says Ellen only got grapes, while the second contradicts that by saying she also got oranges.
