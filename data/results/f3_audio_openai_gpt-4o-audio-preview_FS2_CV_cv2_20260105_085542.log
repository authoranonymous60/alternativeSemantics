--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
B
Because S1 talks about Ellen being the only recipient of grapes, while S2 talks about Tom not receiving grapes. The two statements describe different people and do not logically depend on each other.

1
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen apples.
C
Because S1 states that Ellen was the only recipient of apples, while S2 directly contradicts this by saying Sam didn't give Ellen apples at all.

2
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
C
Because S1 says that Rob was the only recipient of grapes, while S2 contradicts this by claiming Ellen also received grapes.

3
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.
C
Because S1 says Rob was the only recipient of apples, but S2 contradicts this by saying that Ellen also received apples.

4
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.
B
Because S1 talks about Ellen being the only recipient of apples, which does not logically entail or contradict the statement that Sam didn’t give Bill apples. They're independent.

5
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.
B
Because S1 is about Rob being the only recipient of apples, and S2 is about Sue not receiving apples. The two statements describe different people, so they are independent.

6
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.
B
Because S1 is about Rob being the only recipient of oranges, and S2 talks about Rob also being given apples, which are a different fruit. The statements don’t contradict each other but talk about different fruits, so they’re independent.

7
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.
C
Because S1 says that Rob was only given apples, while S2 contradicts this by stating that he also received grapes.

8
S1: Sam only gave Rob BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.
A
Because if Rob was the only recipient of bananas, then it follows logically that Ellen did not receive any bananas. So S2 is entailed by S1.

9
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.
C
Because S1 says that Mary was the only person who received apples, but S2 contradicts this by saying Ellen also received apples.
