You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," which means the restriction is about who received bananas. S1 entails that Bill did not give bananas to anyone else but Bill. However, S2 introduces a different item (grapes) given to Bill, which contradicts the exclusivity implied by S1 about the recipients, turning the statement into a contradiction with respect to Bill being the sole focus of the action (bananas only to Bill).

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave apples only to Mary and not to anyone else. S2 states that Sam also gave apples to Ellen, which directly contradicts the exclusivity in S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning only Sue received apples, and no one else did. S2 now says that Tom also got apples, which contradicts that exclusivity.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Bill was the only person to receive grapes. This doesn’t say anything about oranges, but S1 restricts Bill’s only gift to grapes, which aligns with the fact that Bill didn’t get other items like oranges in S2. Hence, S2 is entailed by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on "BILL," meaning Bill is the only person Sam gave apples to, and no one else received apples from Sam instead of Bill. If Bill only receives apples, then it follows that Bill didn’t receive bananas or any other items, so S2 is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on "SUE," meaning Sue is the only one who got apples (no other person got apples from Sam), and Sue didn’t get other items like bananas. So the statement that Sue didn’t get bananas naturally follows from S1’s exclusivity that Sue only received apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the focus is on "ELLEN," meaning Ellen is the only person who received oranges. If only Ellen got oranges, then it’s entailed that Tom did not get oranges or anyone else besides Ellen.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the focus is on "TOM," meaning only Tom got apples. If Tom is the only person who received apples, then it’s entailed that Mary did not get any apples.

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM," meaning Tom is the sole recipient of apples. If S2 says that Bill also got apples, this contradicts the exclusivity implied by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on "SUE," meaning only Sue got bananas. If Sue is the only person who received bananas, then S2 (which says Tom didn’t get bananas) is entailed by that exclusivity.
