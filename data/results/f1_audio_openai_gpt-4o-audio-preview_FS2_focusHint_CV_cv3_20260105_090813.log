You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," which means Sam did not give grapes to anyone else but Bill. S2 contradicts this by stating that Sam also gave grapes to Sue.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam did not give oranges to anyone else. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave oranges to Rob.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave grapes only to Sue and not to anyone else. S2 is compatible with this, as it states Sam didn’t give grapes to Ellen, which aligns with the restriction placed by "only."

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "apples," meaning Sam gave Tom only apples and nothing else. S2 matches this because it says Sam didn’t give Tom grapes, which aligns with S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "oranges," meaning Sam gave Rob only oranges and nothing else. S2 contradicts this by stating Sam also gave Rob apples.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave grapes only to Sue and not to anyone else. S2 aligns with this, saying Sam didn’t give grapes to Tom, which is consistent with the restriction of S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Ellen and no one else. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave Mary bananas.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Rob and not to anyone else. S2 does not contradict this because it is about something else (oranges), so it’s consistent with S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "bananas," meaning Sam gave Mary only bananas and nothing else. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave Mary apples.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave oranges only to Sue and no one else. S2 aligns with this by saying Sam didn’t give Rob oranges, which is consistent with S1.
