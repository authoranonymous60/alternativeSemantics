You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "APPLES," meaning that Sue didn’t get anything other than apples. S2 says Sue didn’t get bananas, which is consistent with this, since it confirms that Sue did not receive anything else besides apples.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ELLEN." This means Sam only gave oranges to Ellen and nobody else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Tom oranges, which is a separate fact about who else did or did not receive oranges. S2 doesn’t follow directly from S1; it’s independent information.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "TOM." This means that no one except Tom received apples. S2 confirms that Mary didn’t get apples, which is entailed by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "TOM." This means that Tom was the only person to get apples. S2 contradicts this by saying Bill also got apples.

4  
S1: Sam only gave SUE BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE." This means no one else got bananas. S2 says Tom didn’t get bananas, which is entailed by S1. 

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL." This means no one else received grapes besides Bill. S2 states that Sue didn’t get grapes, which aligns with this and is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE." This means no one else received apples besides Sue. S2 says Tom also got apples, which contradicts S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "TOM." This means no one else besides Tom got oranges. S2 says Mary didn’t get oranges, which is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "MARY." This means only Mary got apples. S2 states that Bill didn’t get apples, which follows directly from S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE." This means only Sue got bananas and no one else. S2 says Tom didn’t get bananas, which is entailed by S1.
