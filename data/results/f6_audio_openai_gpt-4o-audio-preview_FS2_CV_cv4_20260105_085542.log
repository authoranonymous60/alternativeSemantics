--- Attempt 1 for f6_cv4 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.
C
Because...

9
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, it logically follows that Sue did not receive apples from Sam.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Sue grapes, it contradicts the idea that Sam also gave Sue oranges.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue grapes, then he didn't give her bananas, which aligns with what S2 says.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
B  
Because "only gave Mary grapes" doesn’t speak about what Sam gave Ellen, so they are independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, it contradicts the statement that he also gave him bananas.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because giving Sue only bananas means he did not give her grapes, so the statements are consistent.

6  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom grapes, it means he did not give him apples, so the statements align.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because giving Tom only bananas means Tom didn’t receive grapes, so the statements are consistent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, he could not have also given him grapes; it’s a direct contradiction.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, it contradicts the idea that he also gave her oranges.
