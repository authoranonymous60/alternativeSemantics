You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else. S2 says he gave Rob bananas, contradicting this focus.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "grapes," meaning Sam didn’t give Rob anything else besides grapes. S2 says he gave Rob oranges, which contradicts this.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "TOM," meaning Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else. S2 says he gave apples to Bill, contradicting this focus.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "APPLES," meaning Sam didn’t give Mary anything besides apples. S2 says he gave her bananas, which contradicts this.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam didn’t give oranges to anyone else. S2 says he gave Sue oranges, which contradicts this.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "oranges," meaning Sam didn’t give Rob anything besides oranges. S2 says he didn’t give Rob apples, which is consistent with that.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else. S2 says he didn’t give Ellen bananas, which aligns with that.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else. S2 says he gave Sue bananas, contradicting this focus.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else. S2 says he didn’t give Mary bananas, which is consistent with that.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam didn’t give grapes to anyone else. S2 says he didn’t give Rob grapes, which is consistent with the focus.
