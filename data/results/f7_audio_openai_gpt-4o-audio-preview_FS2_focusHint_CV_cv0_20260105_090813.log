You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because when the prosodic focus is on "BANANAS," it means that the only thing Sam gave Bill was bananas. Therefore, if S2 says Sam also gave Bill grapes, this contradicts the information in S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because when the prosodic focus is on "MARY," it means that Mary was the only person who received apples from Sam. Therefore, if S2 says Sam also gave Ellen apples, it contradicts the interpretation of S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because when the focus is on "SUE," it means Sue was the only person to receive apples. Therefore, S2, which says that Tom also received apples, contradicts S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Bill GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because when the focus is on "GRAPES," it means that grapes were the only thing Bill received. Therefore, the information in S2, that Bill didn't get oranges, is consistent with S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Bill APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because when the focus is on "APPLES," it means apples were the only thing Bill got. As a result, the statement that Bill didn't get bananas is entailed by the first sentence.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because with prosodic focus on "SUE," it means that Sue was the only person who received apples and nothing else. Therefore, it's consistent with S2 saying she didn't receive bananas.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because with prosodic focus on "ELLEN," it means Ellen is the only person who got oranges. Therefore, the statement in S2 that Tom didn't get oranges is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because when the focus is on "TOM," it means that Tom was the only individual who received apples. Therefore, S2, stating that Mary did not receive apples, is entailed by the first sentence.

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because when the focus is on "TOM," it means Tom is the only one who got apples. S2 says that Bill also got apples, which contradicts S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because with the focus on "BANANAS," it means bananas were the only thing given, and only to Sue. Therefore, the statement that Tom didn’t receive bananas is consistent with S1.
