You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave bananas to Rob, then he could not have given bananas to Tom. The second statement is entailed by the first.

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the fact that Sam only gave Tom grapes doesn't say anything about whether he gave Tom oranges or not. They are independent.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Sue oranges, he couldn't have also given Sue apples. The second statement contradicts the first.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave bananas to Sue, then he didn't give bananas to Rob either. The second statement is entailed by the first.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Tom ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom oranges, then he did not give him bananas. The second statement is entailed by the first.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue apples, then he did not give her oranges. The second statement is entailed by the first.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue grapes, then he did not give her apples. The second statement is entailed by the first.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen oranges, then he could not have also given her bananas. The second statement contradicts the first.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary grapes, then he did not give her apples. The second statement is entailed by the first.

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
B  
Because the fact that Sam only gave Bill oranges doesn't say anything about what he gave Mary. The statements are independent.
