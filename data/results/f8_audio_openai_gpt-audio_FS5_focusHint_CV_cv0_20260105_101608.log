--- Attempt 1 for f8_cv0 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on both the recipient (ROB) and the item (ORANGES). This means Sam gave oranges to Rob and no other item to him, and didn’t give oranges to anyone else. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Rob apples, which is consistent with S1. The claim in S1 thus entails S2.

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on both the recipient (BILL) and the item (BANANAS), meaning that Bill is the exclusive recipient of bananas. S2 states Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas, which is fully entailed by S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on both the recipient (ROB) and the item (BANANAS). This entails that Rob exclusively received bananas and no one else received them. S2 contradicts this by stating that Sue also received bananas.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on both the recipient (BILL) and the item (BANANAS), so Bill is the only person who received bananas. S2 states that Mary didn’t get any bananas, which follows directly from S1 and is entailed by it.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on both the recipient (ELLEN) and the item (GRAPES). This means Ellen exclusively received grapes and no one else did. S2 confirms that Rob didn’t receive grapes, which is fully entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on both the recipient (ROB) and the item (ORANGES). That means Rob was the only person to receive oranges. S2 states that Sue also received oranges, which directly contradicts the exclusivity in S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on both the recipient (BILL) and the item (BANANAS), meaning Bill is the only recipient of bananas. S2 states that Rob also received bananas, which contradicts the exclusive claim in S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because S1 places the focus on ELLEN and GRAPES, meaning only Ellen received grapes. S2 says Bill also received grapes, which contradicts the exclusivity stated in S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on the recipient (BILL) and the item (BANANAS), meaning only Bill received bananas. S2 states that Ellen didn’t receive them, which is directly entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on the recipient (ELLEN) and the item (GRAPES), meaning only Ellen received grapes. S2 states that Rob didn’t receive grapes, and this logically follows and is entailed by S1.
