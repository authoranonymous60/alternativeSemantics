You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus on "BILL" means Sam gave grapes only to Bill and no one else. If S2 says Sam also gave Sue grapes, that contradicts S1's meaning.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus on "SUE" means that Sam only gave oranges to Sue and nobody else. S2 directly contradicts this by saying Sam also gave Rob oranges.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on "SUE", meaning Sam only gave grapes to Sue and no one else. If he didn't give Ellen grapes, that is consistent with S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus on "TOM" means Sam gave apples only to Tom and no one else. It follows that he didn't give Tom anything else like grapes, so S2 is entailed.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the focus on "ROB" means Sam only gave oranges to Rob and nothing else. S2 contradicts this by saying he also gave Rob apples.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus on "SUE" means that Sam gave grapes exclusively to Sue and nobody else. Therefore, it entails that Sam did not give grapes to Tom, making S2 entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus on "ELLEN" means he only gave bananas to Ellen, so S2 states an event (giving to Mary) that is independent of this fact.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.  
B  
Because the focus on "ROB" means Sam gave bananas only to Rob. Whether or not he gave Rob oranges is not addressed by S1, making S2 independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus on "MARY" means Sam only gave bananas to Mary and nothing else. S2 contradicts this by saying he also gave Mary apples.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.  
B  
Because the focus on "SUE" means Sam only gave oranges to Sue. The question of giving oranges to Rob is independent of that statement.
