--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because S1 says the only thing Ellen received from Sam was grapes, but S2 says Ellen also received oranges, which directly contradicts S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because S1 restricts Sam’s giving of apples to Ellen alone, and S2 states that Rob also received apples, introducing a person not mentioned in S1, so S2 is independent of S1’s restriction.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because S1 says that the only thing Sam gave Mary was oranges, which implies that no other fruits (such as bananas) were given to Mary. S2 confirms this by stating Sam didn’t give Mary bananas, and that supports the implication of S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
C  
Because S1’s prosodic focus on "MARY" restricts who received oranges to Mary alone. S2 introduces an additional recipient of oranges—Tom—which contradicts that restriction.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because S1 says that oranges were given only to Mary, and S2 focuses on Tom not receiving oranges. While S2 doesn’t contradict S1, it operates independently, confirming there’s no overlap between Mary and Tom as recipients.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because S1 says that Mary received only grapes from Sam, but S2 introduces apples as something else Sam gave Mary, which contradicts the exclusivity indicated in S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because S1 restricts the giving of apples to Sue alone and says nothing about Mary. S2 adds Mary as another recipient, not contradicting S1 but introducing an independent new fact.

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because S1 sets the exclusive focus on Bill receiving only oranges, while S2 says Bill received bananas as well. This directly contradicts the assertion in S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because S1 restricts Sam’s giving to Ellen to just bananas, while S2 says Ellen also got grapes, which contradicts the exclusivity in S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because S1’s focus on Tom and bananas implies that Tom received no other fruit. S2 states explicitly that Tom didn’t receive oranges, which aligns with that implication, making S2 entailed by S1.
