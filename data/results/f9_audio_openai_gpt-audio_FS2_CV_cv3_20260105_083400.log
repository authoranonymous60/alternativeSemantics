--- Attempt 1 for f9_cv3 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
C
Because the focus in S1 is on Ellen and bananas, meaning Ellen only got bananas. S2 says Sam also gave Ellen grapes, which contradicts the exclusivity implied by "only" in S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Mary oranges.
A
Because S1 states that Mary only received apples. This implies Mary did not receive anything else, including oranges. S2 explicitly says Sam didn't give Mary oranges, which aligns with that implication, so S2 is entailed by S1.

2
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.
C
Because S1 states that Tom only got bananas, emphasizing exclusivity of what Tom received. S2 says that Tom also got apples, directly contradicting the exclusivity asserted in S1.

3
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Mary grapes.
A
Because S1 indicates Mary exclusively received apples and nothing else, which entails that Mary did not receive grapes. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

4
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.
A
Because S1 states Mary exclusively received oranges, meaning she didn’t receive anything else. S2 confirms she didn’t receive apples, which follows directly from the exclusivity implied by S1.

5
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.
B
Because S1 states that Sam only gave Rob apples. It does not state anything about what Sam did or didn’t give to Mary. S2 talks about Mary receiving apples, which is independent of the information in S1. There is no contradiction or entailment.

6
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.
C
Because S1 says that Rob was the only one to receive apples. S2 introducing Tom as also receiving apples contradicts this exclusivity.

7
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.
A
Because if Rob only received oranges, it means Rob didn’t receive bananas or anything else. S2 stating that Rob didn’t get bananas is entailed by that exclusivity.

8
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.
C
Because S1 says that Bill was the only one to receive grapes. S2 introducing Rob as also receiving grapes contradicts the exclusivity stated in S1.

9
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.
C
Because S1 emphasizes that Rob exclusively received grapes and nothing else. S2 asserts that Rob also received bananas, which directly contradicts the exclusivity in S1.
