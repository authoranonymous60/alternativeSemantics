--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on ELLEN. This means that Sam gave grapes to Ellen and no one else. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam didn’t give grapes to Tom, as Tom is not Ellen.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on ELLEN. This means Sam gave apples to Ellen and no one else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Ellen apples, which directly contradicts S1.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on ROB. This means Sam gave grapes only to Rob and no one else. S2 says Sam also gave grapes to Ellen, which contradicts the claim that Rob is the only recipient of grapes.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on ROB. This means Sam gave apples only to Rob and no one else. S2 says Sam also gave apples to Ellen, which contradicts the exclusivity established by S1.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on ELLEN. This means Sam gave apples to Ellen and no one else. It is entailed that Sam didn’t give apples to Bill, since Bill is not Ellen.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on ROB. This means Sam gave apples to Rob and no one else. Therefore, Sam didn’t give apples to Sue, which is entailed by S1.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on ROB. This means Sam gave oranges only to Rob and no one else. S2 talks about apples, so it’s independent. There is no contradiction or entailment because the items (oranges vs. apples) differ.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on ROB. This means Sam gave apples only to Rob and no one else. S2 introduces a different fruit (grapes) and doesn’t change the exclusivity of apples, so it’s independent.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on ROB. This means Sam gave bananas only to Rob and no one else. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam didn’t give bananas to Ellen, as she is not Rob.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on MARY. This means Sam gave apples only to Mary and no one else. S2 introduces Ellen, which contradicts the exclusivity, making it independent here because it breaks that condition.
