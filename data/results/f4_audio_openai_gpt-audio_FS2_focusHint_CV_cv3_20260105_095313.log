You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave apples to Sue and no one else. S2 says Sam also gave Rob apples, which contradicts that exclusivity.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave apples to Bill and no one else. S2 talks about Mary not getting apples, which doesn’t confirm or contradict who else received apples besides Bill, so they are independent.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave oranges to Mary and no one else. S2 states that Sam also gave Ellen oranges, which contradicts the exclusivity implied by S1.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave apples to Ellen and no one else. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Tom apples, which is consistent with S1’s exclusivity.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave bananas to Rob and no one else. S2 says Sam also gave Rob oranges, which contradicts this focus, as it implies that Rob received something other than just bananas.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave bananas to Bill and no one else. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Bill grapes, which aligns with S1’s implication that Bill only received bananas.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam gave only oranges to Ellen and nothing else to Ellen. S2 confirms that Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes, which matches the exclusivity in S1.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave Mary BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BANANAS," meaning Sam gave only bananas to Mary (and not oranges, etc.). S2 talks about Ellen not getting bananas, which does not relate to or affect who Mary received bananas from, making it independent.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Bill and no one else. S2 confirms that Sam didn’t give Tom bananas, which is consistent with S1’s exclusivity.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "oranges," meaning Sam gave Sue only oranges and no other fruits. S2 confirms Sue didn’t receive grapes, which aligns with the exclusivity conveyed by S1.
