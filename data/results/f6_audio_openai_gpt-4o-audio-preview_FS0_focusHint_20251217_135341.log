You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Your output must follow this structure:

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference.  You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.

0
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.
A
Because focusing on "ROB" means Sam didn't give apples to anyone else, so Sam not giving Sue apples is consistent.

1
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.
C
Because focusing on "SUE" means Sam gave grapes only to Sue and nothing else, so giving Sue oranges contradicts that.

2
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.
A
Because focusing on "SUE" means Sam gave only grapes to Sue, so it's entailed that Sue didn’t get bananas.

3
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
C
Because focusing on "MARY" means Sam gave grapes only to Mary and not to anyone else, so giving grapes to Ellen contradicts that.

4
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.
C
Because focusing on "oranges" means Sam gave only oranges to Rob, so giving Rob bananas contradicts that.

5
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.
A
Because focusing on "bananas" means Sam gave only bananas to Sue, so Sue not getting grapes is entailed.

6
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.
A
Because focusing on "grapes" means Sam gave only grapes to Tom, so Tom not getting apples is entailed.

7
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
A
Because focusing on "bananas" means Sam gave only bananas to Tom, so Tom not getting grapes is entailed.

8
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.
C
Because focusing on "apples" means Sam gave only apples to Rob, so giving him grapes contradicts that.

9
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.
C
Because focusing on "grapes" means Sam gave only grapes to Ellen, so giving her oranges contradicts that.
