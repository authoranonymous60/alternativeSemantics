You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave grapes to Ellen, that excludes giving grapes to anyone else, including Tom.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen apples, that already excludes any other fruit being given to Ellen, including oranges.

2  
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave grapes to Rob, giving grapes to anyone else, like Ellen, contradicts that statement.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Rob, giving apples to Ellen is a contradiction.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Ellen, that means no apples were given to Bill or anyone else, so it's entailed.

5  
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Rob, it excludes giving apples to anyone else, including Sue.

6  
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, he cannot have also given him apples. It’s a contradiction.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, giving him grapes would contradict that.

8  
S1: Sam only gave Rob BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob bananas, it means he didn’t give bananas to Ellen or anyone else, so it's entailed.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Mary, then giving apples to Ellen contradicts that statement.
