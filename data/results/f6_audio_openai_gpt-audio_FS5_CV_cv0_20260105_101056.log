You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on Sue and bananas. "Only gave Sue bananas" means he did not give Sue anything else, including grapes, so S2 is entailed by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
A  
Because focusing on Tom and grapes implies no apples were given to Tom. Thus, S2 follows directly from S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus on Tom and bananas means he didn’t give Tom anything else, including grapes. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, then giving Rob grapes would contradict that. S2 contradicts S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because saying Sam only gave Ellen grapes excludes oranges. Therefore, giving Ellen oranges contradicts the "only" statement in S1. 

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Sue bananas, then giving her grapes contradicts that. S2 goes against what S1 states.

6  
S1: Sam only gave TOM GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom bananas.  
C  
Because if it’s only grapes that Tom received, then giving him bananas contradicts that. S2 contradicts S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because the focus indicates that Tom only received bananas, so giving him grapes would contradict that. S2 contradicts S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the "only" statement excludes anything but apples. Thus, giving Rob grapes would contradict S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because stating that Sam only gave Ellen grapes excludes oranges or anything else. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.
