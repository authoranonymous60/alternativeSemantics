You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

--- Raw Model Output ---

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen bananas, then by definition he did not give Ellen anything else. The statement that Sam also gave Ellen grapes contradicts this, since it adds another item given to Ellen.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, that means he did not give her anything else. The statement that he didn’t give Mary oranges is fully consistent with this, and thus it is entailed.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Tom bananas, then he did not give Tom anything else. The statement that Sam also gave Tom apples directly contradicts that focus, so it’s a contradiction.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, then he did not give her anything else. The statement that he didn’t give Mary grapes is fully consistent with this, so it is entailed.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary oranges, then he gave her no other fruits, including no apples. The statement that he didn’t give Mary apples is consistent with that, so it is entailed.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because the focus on Rob means that Sam gave apples to Rob and not to anyone else. The statement that Sam also gave Mary apples is about a different person, introducing a new piece of information unrelated to whether Rob received something else. This makes the statements independent.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
B  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, then no one else received apples from him. But the statement that Sam also gave Tom apples introduces new information about Tom that is not consistent with that focus. This classifies it as a contradiction.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, it means he gave Rob no other fruit. The statement that he didn’t give Rob bananas is fully consistent with that, making it entailed.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Bill grapes, then no one else got grapes from Sam. The statement that he also gave Rob grapes contradicts that claim directly, so it is a contradiction.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
B  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, this means that grapes were the only thing he gave Rob. The statement that he also gave Rob bananas contradicts that restriction by adding a new item given to Rob, so it’s a contradiction.
