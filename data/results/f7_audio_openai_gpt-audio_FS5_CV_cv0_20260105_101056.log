You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
B  
Because the statement that Sam didn't give Sue bananas is independent of the assertion that he only gave her apples. It doesn't contradict or confirm the first sentence directly.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the statement about not giving Tom oranges is independent of the statement that Sam only gave Ellen oranges. It doesn’t entail or contradict S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom apples, it follows that he did not give apples to anyone else, including Mary.

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because the second statement contradicts the first. If Sam only gave Tom apples, then he didn’t give Bill apples.

4  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue bananas, it entails that no one else, including Tom, received bananas.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary grapes, then it’s necessarily entailed that he didn’t give grapes to anyone else, including Ellen.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill oranges, it entails that Sue did not receive oranges.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
C  
Because the second statement contradicts the first: if Sam only gave Tom bananas, then he couldn’t have also given him oranges.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because the second statement contradicts the first: if Sam only gave Ellen apples, then giving Sue apples would be a contradiction.

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill bananas, that entails that he did not give Tom bananas or anyone else bananas.
