You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.
A
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave apples to Rob and not to anyone else. This entails that Sam didn't give apples to Sue or anyone else, so S2 logically follows from S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.
B
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave grapes to Sue and no one else. This does not say anything about whether Sam gave Sue other things. S2 mentions that Sam gave Sue oranges as well, which is independent of the information in S1.

2
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.
A
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave grapes to Sue and not to anyone else. It also means that grapes were the sole thing given to Sue, so it entails that Sam didn't give Sue bananas. S2 is therefore entailed by S1.

3
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
C
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave grapes to Mary and not to anyone else. S2 says that Sam also gave grapes to Ellen, which contradicts the inference from S1 that no one else received grapes.

4
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.
C
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "oranges," meaning Sam gave oranges to Rob and nothing else. S2 states that Sam also gave Rob bananas, which contradicts the inference that oranges were the only thing given to Rob.

5
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.
A
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "bananas," meaning the only thing Sam gave to Sue was bananas. This entails that Sam didn’t give Sue anything else, including grapes. So S2 logically follows from S1.

6
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.
A
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "grapes," meaning the only thing Sam gave to Tom was grapes. This entails that Sam didn’t give Tom apples or anything else. So S2 directly follows from S1.

7
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
A
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "bananas," meaning that bananas were the only thing Sam gave to Tom. This entails that Sam didn’t give Tom grapes or any other items. So S2 is entailed by S1.

8
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.
C
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "apples," meaning Sam gave only apples to Rob and nothing else. S2 says that Sam also gave Rob grapes, which contradicts the inference from S1.

9
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.
C
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning that grapes were given to Ellen and not to anyone else. However, unlike S1 focusing on the item, S2 says that oranges were also given to Ellen. This contradicts the idea that only grapes were given to Ellen. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.
