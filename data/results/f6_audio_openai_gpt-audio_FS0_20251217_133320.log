You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

7

Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference.  You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.
