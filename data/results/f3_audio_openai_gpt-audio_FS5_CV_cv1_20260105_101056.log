--- Attempt 1 for f3_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, that excludes giving grapes to anyone else, including Tom.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.  
C  
Because S1 says Sam only gave Ellen apples, meaning Ellen definitely got apples, while S2 contradicts this by saying Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because S1 says that Sam only gave grapes to Rob, excluding anyone else, while S2 contradicts S1 by stating that Ellen also received grapes.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because S1 says that Sam only gave apples to Rob, excluding everyone else, while S2 contradicts S1 by stating that Ellen also received apples.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because S1 says that Sam only gave apples to Ellen, excluding others, and that entails Sam didn’t give apples to Bill, so S2 follows logically.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, that excludes giving apples to anyone else, including Sue, so S2 logically follows from S1.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because giving Rob apples doesn’t contradict or follow from giving Rob only oranges. The two sentences describe independent actions about different items.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because giving Rob grapes doesn’t contradict or follow from giving Rob only apples. The two actions are about different items and thus are independent.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave bananas to Rob, that excludes giving bananas to anyone else, including Ellen, so S2 logically follows from S1.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
B  
Because giving apples to Ellen would contradict giving apples only to Mary, but we don’t have confirmation that S1 or S2 is false; rather, they are discussing actions that would be contradictory. As it stands, they are independent statements, as S2 does not follow logically from S1 and does not directly confirm the truth of S1. They are just offering different perspectives on possible actions.
