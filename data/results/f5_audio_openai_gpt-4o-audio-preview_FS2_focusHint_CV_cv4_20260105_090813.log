--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because if the focus is on "grapes," the sentence implies that grapes are the only thing Ellen received. The second sentence contradicts this by saying Ellen also received oranges.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the first sentence focuses on what Ellen received, implying she only got apples and nothing else. The second sentence is independent because it talks about Rob receiving apples, which does not affect what Ellen got.

2  
S1: Sam only gave Mary ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because if the focus is on "oranges," the first sentence means Mary got only oranges and nothing else. The second sentence saying Mary didn’t get bananas aligns with that, so it’s entailed.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Mary ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the first sentence focuses on what Mary received, implying she only got oranges. The second sentence is independent because it talks about Tom receiving oranges, which does not contradict or entail anything about what Mary got.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Mary ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the first sentence focuses on Mary only receiving oranges. The second sentence is independent, as it talks about Tom’s situation, which is unrelated to Mary’s.

5  
S1: Sam only gave Mary GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because if the focus is on "grapes," it implies that grapes are the only thing Mary received. The second sentence contradicts this by saying Mary also received apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave Sue APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because the first sentence focuses on Sue only receiving apples. The second sentence is independent, as it talks about Mary’s situation, which does not affect Sue’s.

7  
S1: Sam only gave Bill ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because if the focus is on "oranges," it means Bill only received oranges. The second sentence contradicts this by saying Bill also received bananas.

8  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if the focus is on "bananas," the sentence means Ellen only received bananas. The second sentence contradicts this by stating she also got grapes.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Tom BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because if the focus is on "bananas," it means Tom only received bananas. The second sentence is entailed, as it confirms Tom didn’t receive anything else, such as oranges.
