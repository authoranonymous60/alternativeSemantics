--- Attempt 1 for f6_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
B  
Because S1 states that Sam gave apples only to Rob, which does not necessarily entail whether Sam gave apples to anyone else besides Rob. S2 mentions Sue specifically and places a negative focus on her, which is independent of S1 since S1 does not address Sue at all.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because S1 asserts that the only thing Sam gave to Sue was grapes, so the claim in S2 that Sam also gave Sue oranges directly contradicts that.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue grapes, it follows that Sam didn’t give Sue bananas or anything else, so S2 is entailed by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Mary GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
B  
Because S1 is specifically about Mary and what Sam gave her, and it does not say anything about Ellen. Therefore, S2 is independent of S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because S1 states that the only thing Sam gave Rob was oranges, so if S2 claims that Sam also gave Rob bananas, that directly contradicts S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue bananas, that means he didn’t give her any other fruit, including grapes. So S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom grapes, it follows that he did not give Tom apples. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom bananas, he did not give Tom any other fruit, including grapes, so S2 is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because S1 states that the only thing Sam gave Rob was apples, so S2’s claim that Sam also gave Rob grapes directly contradicts that.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because S1 asserts that Sam only gave Ellen grapes, and S2 says Sam gave Ellen oranges as well, which contradicts S1.
