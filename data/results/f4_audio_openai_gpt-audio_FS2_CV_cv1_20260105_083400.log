--- Attempt 1 for f4_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.
C
Because the use of "only" in S1 means that Sue was the exclusive recipient of apples. S2 contradicts this by saying that Rob also received apples.

1
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.
B
Because the sentence about Mary in S2 is independent and doesn’t affect the statement in S1 about Bill being the only recipient of apples.

2
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.
C
Because the word "only" indicates that Mary was the sole recipient of oranges. S2 contradicts S1 by stating that Ellen was also a recipient of oranges.

3
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.
B
Because the statement about Tom in S2 is independent of S1. S1 is about Ellen being the only recipient of apples, while S2 doesn’t affect or contradict that claim.

4
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.
B
Because S1 states that Rob was the only person who received bananas. S2 says something about oranges, which is independent of the claim about bananas.

5
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill grapes.
A
Because S1 says Bill received only bananas, and S2 (saying Bill didn’t get grapes) aligns with that. There’s no contradiction, and S2 is entailed by S1.

6
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.
A
Because if Ellen only received oranges (S1), then she didn’t receive grapes. S2 is entailed by S1.

7
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.
B
Because S1 talks about Mary being the only recipient of bananas. S2 involves Ellen and is independent of whether Mary got bananas or not.

8
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.
A
Because if Bill was the only recipient of bananas, then it follows that Tom didn’t get bananas. S2 is entailed by S1.

9
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.
A
Because if Sue only received oranges, it means she received no other fruit. Therefore, S2 (saying she didn’t get grapes) is entailed by S1.
