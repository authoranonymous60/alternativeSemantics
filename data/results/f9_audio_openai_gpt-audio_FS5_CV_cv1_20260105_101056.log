--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the word "only" indicates a restriction to bananas. The second sentence contradicts this by saying Ellen also got grapes.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because the focus on "only ... apples" entails that Mary did not get oranges. So the second sentence aligns with that.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because by focusing on "bananas," it excludes that Tom received anything else. The second sentence contradicts this by stating Tom also got apples.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, it entails that Mary did not get grapes. The second sentence is consistent with this.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the focus on "only ... oranges" excludes giving apples. The second sentence confirms this by saying Mary didn’t get apples.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because the focus is on what Rob received, and the second sentence talks about Mary receiving apples. This is independent information and does not contradict or entail it.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "only ... Rob" excludes anyone else getting apples. The second sentence says Tom also got apples, which contradicts the focus.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because by stating Sam only gave Rob oranges, we exclude other fruits, like bananas. The second sentence aligns with this.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave Bill GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the focus is on Bill receiving grapes. The second sentence states Rob also got grapes, but it does not contradict or follow from the first sentence; it’s about a different person.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the focus restricts what Rob got to only grapes, and the second sentence contradicts this by saying Rob also got bananas.
