You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Your output must follow this structure:

S1: ...
S2: ...

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference.  You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.

0  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because S1 focuses on TOM, meaning Sam didn't give anyone else apples. S2 contradicts S1 by asserting that Sam gave something else (grapes) to Tom, which conflicts with the implied restriction of only apples to Tom.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Tom GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
C  
Because S1 focuses on GRAPES, meaning Sam didn't give Tom anything else. S2 contradicts S1 by asserting that Sam gave Tom something else (oranges), which conflicts with the restriction in S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
B  
Because S1 focuses on MARY, meaning Sam didn’t give anyone else bananas. S2 states something about Bill, which is unrelated to Mary and doesn’t conflict or follow from S1. It’s independent.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because S1 focuses on APPLES, meaning Sam didn’t give Mary anything else. S2 contradicts S1 by asserting that Mary also received something else (bananas).

4  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because S1 focuses on SUE, meaning Sam didn’t give anyone else apples. S2 fits under that restriction by stating that Rob didn’t get apples, which is entailed by S1’s focus.

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because S1 focuses on BANANAS, meaning Sam didn’t give Bill anything else. S2 contradicts S1 by asserting that Bill also received grapes.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because S1 focuses on ROB, meaning Sam didn’t give anyone else grapes. S2 is consistent with S1 and also fits the focus, as it states that Rob didn’t get something else (apples), which aligns with the idea that the only thing Rob got was grapes.

7  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because S1 focuses on SUE, meaning Sam didn’t give anyone else grapes. S2 contradicts that by stating that Tom also got grapes, which violates the restriction imposed by the focus on Sue.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because S1 focuses on ELLEN, meaning Sam didn’t give anyone else grapes. S2 is consistent with that focus by stating that Rob didn’t receive grapes, which is in line with S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because S1 focuses on GRAPES, meaning Sam didn’t give Mary anything else. S2 contradicts S1 by asserting that Mary also received bananas, which conflicts with the restriction in S1.
