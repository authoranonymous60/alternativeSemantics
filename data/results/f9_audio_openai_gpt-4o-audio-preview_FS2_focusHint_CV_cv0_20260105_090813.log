You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam didn't give bananas to anyone else. However, this doesn't restrict the type of fruit he gave to Ellen. The statement in S2 indicates Sam gave Ellen a different fruit as well, which contradicts the exclusivity implied by "only" in S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because the focus is on "MARY," meaning Sam didn't give apples to anyone else besides Mary. The type of fruit isn't restricted, so apples are the focus. This logically entails that Sam didn't give Mary different types of fruit like oranges. 

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the focus is on "TOM," meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else besides Tom. However, S2 indicates that Sam gave Tom another type of fruit, which contradicts the implication that Tom only received bananas.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary grapes.  
B  
Because the focus is on "MARY," meaning no one else received apples. This has no direct implication about whether Mary received other kinds of fruit, like grapes. Therefore, S2 doesn't logically follow or contradict S1. It's independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the focus is on "MARY," meaning Sam did not give oranges to anyone else. The type of fruit is "oranges," and that excludes that Sam gave Mary other types of fruit like apples. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus is on "ROB," meaning no one else besides Rob got apples. S2 contradicts this by stating that Mary also got apples, which goes directly against the exclusivity of S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave TOM apples.  
C  
Because the focus is on "ROB," which indicates that no one else besides Rob got apples. S2 states that Tom also received apples, contradicting S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on "ROB," meaning he only received oranges and nothing else. This entails that Rob did not get other fruits like bananas. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB grapes.  
C   
Because the focus is on "BILL," meaning only Bill got grapes. S2 contradicts this by saying that Rob also got grapes, breaking the exclusivity implied by "only."

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
B  
Because the focus is on "ROB," meaning no one else got grapes besides Rob. However, nothing in S1 precludes Rob from receiving other fruits. Thus, S2 is independent of S1.
