--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning the sentence entails that the only person Sam gave bananas to is Bill, and not to anyone else. S2, stating that Sam didn’t give Bill grapes, aligns with that interpretation because it discusses what else Bill did not receive, without contradicting the original statement. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN." This means Sam gave oranges only to Ellen and no one else. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes, which does not contradict S1 and is consistent with it. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning that Mary was the only person to whom Sam gave bananas. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas, which aligns with S1 because it confirms that no one else, including Ellen, received bananas. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," which means Bill is the only person who received bananas from Sam. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Tom bananas, which aligns with S1 because it confirms that no one else, including Tom, received bananas. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sue is the only person Sam gave oranges to. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Sue grapes, which aligns with S1 because it speaks to other items Sue didn’t receive, without contradicting the original focus on oranges. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Rob is the only person Sam gave apples to. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Rob oranges, which is consistent with the focus on Rob and doesn’t contradict that he only received apples. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave KATE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Kate apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "KATE," meaning Kate is the only person who received grapes from Sam. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Kate apples, which does not contradict S1 since S1 specifies the kind of item given (grapes), not other items she didn't receive. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM," meaning that Tom is the only person Sam gave oranges to. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Tom bananas, which is consistent with S1, because the sentence is only about oranges for Tom. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ANNA apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Anna grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ANNA," meaning Anna is the only person Sam gave apples to. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Anna grapes, which is consistent with and does not contradict the original statement about what Anna exclusively received. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARK grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mark bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARK," meaning Mark is the only person Sam gave grapes to. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Mark bananas, which does not contradict the first sentence, as it deals with other possible items not given to Mark. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.
