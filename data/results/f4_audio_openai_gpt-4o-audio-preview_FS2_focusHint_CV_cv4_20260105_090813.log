--- Attempt 1 for f4_cv4 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because by saying "Sam only gave SUE apples," it means that no one else received apples from Sam. However, S2 says that Sam also gave apples to Rob, which directly contradicts the exclusive focus on Sue from S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because by saying "Sam only gave BILL apples," it means he gave apples to Bill and no one else. Therefore, it entails that Mary did not receive any apples from Sam.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because by saying "Sam only gave MARY oranges," it means that no one else, besides Mary, received oranges. S2 contradicts this by claiming that Sam also gave oranges to Ellen.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.  
A  
Because by saying "Sam only gave ELLEN apples," it means that no one other than Ellen received apples. Therefore, it entails that Tom did not receive any apples from Sam.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on bananas given to Rob, meaning no one else received bananas. S2 talks about oranges, which is a different item, so they are independent statements.

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because by saying "Sam only gave BILL bananas," it means Bill received no other item besides bananas. Therefore, it entails that Bill did not receive grapes.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because by saying "Sam only gave ELLEN oranges," it means that Ellen received only oranges and nothing else. Therefore, it entails that Ellen did not receive grapes.

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because by saying "Sam only gave MARY bananas," it means Mary received all the bananas and no one else did. Therefore, it entails that Ellen did not receive bananas.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because by saying "Sam only gave BILL bananas," it means Bill was the only one who received bananas, so it follows that Tom did not receive bananas.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because by saying "Sam only gave SUE oranges," it means Sue received only oranges and no other items. Therefore, it entails that Sue did not receive grapes.
