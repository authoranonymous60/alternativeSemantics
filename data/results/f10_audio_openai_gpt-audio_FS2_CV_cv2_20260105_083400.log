--- Attempt 1 for f10_cv2 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because saying "only gave TOM apples" means Tom got no other fruits. Saying "also gave Tom grapes" contradicts that, as it adds another fruit for Tom.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
B  
Because the statement about Mary and bananas doesn’t entail or contradict anything about Bill. The two statements are independent; one is about Mary, the other about Bill.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because "only gave MARY apples" suggests that Mary got no other fruit. The second statement claims she got bananas, which contradicts the first.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
B  
Because the first statement is about Sue’s apples, and the second is about Rob’s apples. There’s no entailment or contradiction between them.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
B  
Because the first sentence limits what Bill received to bananas, and the second introduces grapes. The two statements are independent in content.

5  
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because saying Rob only received grapes entails that he didn’t receive apples. The second sentence is consistent with that.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
B  
Because the first is about what Sue received (just grapes), and the second about what Tom received (also grapes). They don’t entail or contradict each other.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
B  
Because Ellen’s situation and Rob’s situation are separate. The first says Ellen only got grapes. It says nothing about Rob, so the second is independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the first sentence limits Mary’s gift to only grapes. The second adds bananas, contradicting that.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
B  
Because Sue’s apples and Bill’s apples are unrelated here. Knowing Sue got only apples doesn’t determine anything about Bill, so they’re independent.
