0
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.

Because S1 says Ellen received only grapes from Sam (nothing else). S2 says she also got oranges, which contradicts S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.

Because S1 says Ellen is the only person who got apples from Sam. S2 says Rob also got apples, which contradicts S1.

2
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.

C
Because S1 says only Mary received oranges. S2 says Tom also received oranges, which contradicts S1.

4
S1: Sam only gave Mary ORANGES.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.

Because S1 says Mary received only oranges from Sam; it says nothing about whether Tom got oranges. So S2 is not entailed or contradicted.

C
Because S1 says Mary received only grapes from Sam. S2 says she also got apples, which contradicts S1.
