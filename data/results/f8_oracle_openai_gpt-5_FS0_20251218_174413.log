0
S1: Sam only gave Ellen BANANAS.
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.
B
Because S1 restricts what Ellen received (only bananas) and says nothing about what Rob received; giving Rob bananas is compatible but not entailed.

1
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.
B
Because S1 says Rob is the only recipient of grapes; it says nothing about whether Rob also got oranges, so S2 is compatible but not entailed.

2
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.
C
Because S1 says Tom is the only recipient of apples; S2 claims Bill also received apples, which contradicts S1.

3
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.
C
Because S1 says the only thing Mary received was apples; S2 says she also got bananas, which contradicts S1.

4
S1: Sam only gave Ellen ORANGES.
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.
B
Because S1 restricts what Ellen received (only oranges) but does not restrict who else could receive oranges; S2 is compatible but not entailed.

5
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.
A
Because if Rob only got oranges from Sam, then he did not get apples; S2 follows.

6
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.
B
Because S1 restricts what Bill received and says nothing about Ellen; whether Ellen got bananas is undetermined.

7
S1: Sam only gave Rob BANANAS.
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.
B
Because S1 restricts what Rob received (only bananas) but does not restrict who else could receive bananas; S2 is compatible but not entailed.

8
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn't give Mary bananas.
B
Because S1 concerns only what Bill received and says nothing about Mary; whether Mary got bananas is undetermined.

9
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.
B
Because S1 restricts what Ellen received (only grapes) and says nothing about whether Rob received grapes; S2 is not entailed nor contradicted.
