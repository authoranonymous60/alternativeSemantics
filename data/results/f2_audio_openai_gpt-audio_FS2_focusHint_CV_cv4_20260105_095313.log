You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ROB." The sentence means that Sam gave bananas to Rob and to no one else. Therefore, it entails that Sam didn’t give bananas to Tom.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "TOM." The sentence means that Sam gave grapes to Tom and nothing else to Tom. Therefore, it entails that Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "oranges." This means that the only thing Sam gave Sue was oranges. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave Sue apples.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE." The sentence states that Sue was the only recipient of bananas. This doesn’t entail anything about whether Rob got bananas, so S2 is independent.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "oranges." This means oranges were the only thing Sam gave Tom. It entails that Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "apples." This means apples were the only thing Sam gave Sue. It entails that Sam didn’t give Sue oranges.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "grapes." This means grapes were the only thing Sam gave Sue. It entails that Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "oranges." This means oranges were the only thing Sam gave Ellen. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "grapes." This means grapes were the only thing Sam gave Mary. It entails that Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL." This means Bill was the only recipient of oranges. S2 contradicts this by saying that Sam also gave Mary oranges.
