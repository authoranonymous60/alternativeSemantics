--- Attempt 1 for f8_cv4 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because S1 states that Ellen was the only recipient of bananas, and S2 contradicts that by saying Rob also received bananas.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
B  
Because S1 limits Rob as the only recipient of grapes, but S2 introduces an independent fact about Rob receiving oranges, not contradicting or entailed by the original statement.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because S1 asserts that Tom is the exclusive recipient of apples, and S2 contradicts this by saying Bill also got apples.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
B  
Because S1 limits Mary as the exclusive recipient of apples, but S2 introduces a new fact (Mary also getting bananas), which is independent of the claim about apples.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because S1 says that Ellen was the only one to receive oranges, and S2 contradicts that by adding that Sue also received oranges.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
B  
Because S1 specifies Rob as the only recipient of oranges, but S2 mentions something different (not giving Rob apples), which is independent of the focus on oranges in S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if Bill was the only one to get bananas (S1), then it follows that Ellen didn’t get bananas as well (S2), meaning S2 is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
C  
Because S1 asserts that Rob was the sole recipient of bananas, and S2 contradicts that by saying Sue also got bananas.

8  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because if Ellen is the only recipient of grapes (S1), then it necessarily follows that Rob didn’t receive grapes (S2).

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because if Bill was the only one who received bananas (S1), then it follows that Mary didn’t get bananas, making S2 entailed.
