You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on TOM, meaning Sam gave apples only to Tom and not to anyone else. S2 says Sam also gave apples to Bill, which contradicts the claim in S1.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave Tom APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on APPLES, meaning Sam gave only apples to Tom and not anything else. S2 says Sam also gave Tom bananas, which contradicts the claim in S1.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on MARY, meaning Sam gave bananas only to Mary and not to anyone else. S2 talks about Bill and states that he didn’t receive bananas. That’s independent of S1 and doesn’t contradict or entail it.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on APPLES, meaning Sam gave only apples to Mary and not anything else. S2 says Sam also gave her bananas, contradicting the claim in S1.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on SUE, meaning Sam gave apples only to Sue and not to anyone else. S2 states that Rob didn’t get apples. This is independent, as it doesn’t confirm or contradict what S1 specifically says.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on BANANAS, meaning Sam gave only bananas to Bill and not anything else. S2 says Sam also gave him grapes, which contradicts the claim in S1.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on GRAPES, meaning Sam gave only grapes to Rob. That entails that he didn’t give Rob any other fruit, including apples, confirming S2.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave SUE GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on SUE, meaning Sam gave grapes only to Sue and not to anyone else. S2 says that Tom also received grapes, which contradicts the claim in S1.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on ELLEN, meaning Sam gave grapes only to Ellen and not to anyone else. S2 states that Rob didn’t get grapes. This is independent, since it doesn’t confirm or contradict that only Ellen received grapes.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on GRAPES, meaning Sam gave only grapes to Mary and not anything else. S2 says Sam also gave Mary bananas, which contradicts the claim in S1.
