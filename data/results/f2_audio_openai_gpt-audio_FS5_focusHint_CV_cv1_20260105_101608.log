--- Attempt 1 for f2_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Rob and no one else. Thus, it entails that Sam didn't give Tom (or anyone else) bananas.

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "grapes," meaning Sam only gave Tom grapes (and not any other fruit). Thus, it entails that Sam didn't give Tom oranges or any other items besides grapes.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "oranges," meaning Sam only gave Sue oranges and no other items. S2 says Sam also gave Sue apples, which contradicts this.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave bananas to Sue and no one else. This doesn't entail anything about Rob directly. S2 mentions Rob, but that information is independent of what S1 states.

4  
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "oranges," meaning Sam gave Tom only oranges and no other items. Therefore, it entails that Sam didn't give Tom bananas.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "apples," meaning Sam gave Sue only apples and no other items, like oranges. So, it entails that Sam didn't give Sue oranges.

6  
S1: Sam only gave Sue GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "GRAPES," meaning Sue received only grapes and nothing else. Thus, it entails that Sue didn't receive apples or any other items.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave oranges to Ellen and no one else. S2 states that Ellen also got bananas, which contradicts the idea that oranges were the only thing given.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Mary was the only person who got grapes. This doesn't directly entail anything about whether Mary got other items besides grapes, so it’s independent of whether she got apples.

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Bill was the only recipient of oranges. S2 says Mary also got oranges, which contradicts S1.
