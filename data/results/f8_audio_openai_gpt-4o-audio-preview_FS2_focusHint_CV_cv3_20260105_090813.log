--- Attempt 1 for f8_cv3 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because "Sam only gave ELLEN bananas" means Ellen did receive bananas but no one else received bananas from Sam. The second sentence contradicts this by saying Ellen didn't receive bananas at all.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because "Sam only gave ROB grapes" means that Rob got grapes from Sam and nobody else got grapes. It also means Rob got nothing else besides grapes. The second sentence contradicts this by saying Rob also got oranges.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because "Sam only gave TOM apples" means that Tom received apples and no one else did. The second sentence contradicts this by saying Bill also got apples.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because "Sam only gave MARY APPLES" means Mary only received apples and nothing else. The second sentence contradicts this by saying Mary also got bananas.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because "Sam only gave ELLEN oranges" means Ellen is the only person who got oranges. The second sentence contradicts this by saying Sue also got oranges.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
A  
Because "Sam only gave ROB ORANGES" means Rob only received oranges and nothing else. The second sentence is consistent with that, confirming he didn’t get apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because "Sam only gave BILL bananas" means Bill is the only one who got bananas, so it entails that Ellen didn’t get bananas.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
C  
Because "Sam only gave ROB BANANAS" means Rob is the only one who got bananas, and the second sentence contradicts this by saying Sue also got bananas.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because "Sam only gave BILL bananas" means Bill is the only one who got bananas, so it entails that Mary didn’t get any.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because "Sam only gave ELLEN grapes" means Ellen is the only one who got grapes, so it entails that Rob didn’t get any grapes.
