--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.
C
Because S1 says Bill received only bananas, while S2 says Bill received grapes as well, contradicting the exclusivity implied in S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.
C
Because S1 states that only Mary received apples, while S2 says that Ellen also received apples, contradicting the exclusivity in S1.

2
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.
C
Because S1 claims Sue was the only recipient of apples, but S2 claims that Tom also received apples, contradicting the exclusivity asserted in S1.

3
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill oranges.
A
Because S1 says Bill only received grapes, and S2 says Bill didn’t receive oranges, which doesn’t conflict and is consistent with the exclusivity of grapes in S1.

4
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.
A
Because S1 says that Bill only received apples, and S2 says Bill didn’t receive bananas, which aligns with the idea that Bill received only apples.

5
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.
A
Because S1 says that Sue only received apples, and S2 confirms Sue didn’t receive bananas, which is consistent with the exclusivity of apples stated in S1.

6
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.
B
Because S1 is about Ellen receiving only oranges, and S2 is about Tom not receiving oranges. S2 provides independent information about Tom and does not contradict or follow from S1.

7
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.
A
Because S1 says Tom is the only recipient of apples, and S2 says Mary didn’t receive apples, which supports the exclusivity claim.

8
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.
C
Because S1 says Tom is the only one who received apples, while S2 says Bill also received apples, directly contradicting the exclusivity in S1.

9
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.
A
Because S1 says only Sue received bananas, and S2 supports that by saying Tom didn’t receive bananas, which is consistent with S1.
