--- Attempt 1 for f6_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave apples only to Rob and not to anyone else. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam didn't give apples to Sue.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave grapes only to Sue and not to anyone else. This also implies that Sam only gave grapes to Sue, so the statement that Sam also gave Sue oranges contradicts that.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave grapes only to Sue and not to anyone else. This means Sue did not receive anything else from Sam, so it is entailed that she didn't get bananas.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave grapes only to Mary and not to anyone else. Therefore, the statement that Sam also gave grapes to Ellen contradicts this.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam gave oranges only to Rob and not anything else to Rob. Therefore, the statement that Sam also gave Rob bananas contradicts this.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "bananas," meaning Sam only gave bananas to Sue and not anything else. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam didn't give Sue grapes.

6  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "grapes," meaning Sam only gave grapes to Tom and nothing else. Therefore, it is entailed that he didn't give Tom apples.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "bananas," meaning Sam only gave bananas to Tom and not anything else. This entails that Tom didn't get grapes.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "apples," meaning Sam only gave apples to Rob and nothing else. The statement that Sam also gave Rob grapes contradicts this.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave grapes only to Ellen and not anyone else. Furthermore, it implies he only gave grapes to her, so the statement that he also gave her oranges contradicts this.
