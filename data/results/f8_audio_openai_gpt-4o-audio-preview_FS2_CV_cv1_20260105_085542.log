--- Attempt 1 for f8_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because "only gave Ellen bananas" implies no one else received bananas, so saying Sam also gave Rob bananas contradicts that.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because "only gave Rob grapes" implies Rob did not receive anything else like oranges, so the second sentence contradicts the first.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because "only gave Tom apples" means apples were exclusive to Tom, so giving them to Bill contradicts that.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because "only gave Mary apples" excludes giving her any other fruits like bananas, so the second sentence contradicts the first.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because "only gave Ellen oranges" excludes giving oranges to anyone else, so giving them to Sue contradicts the first sentence.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because "only gave Rob oranges" implies that Rob received oranges and nothing else, so not giving him apples is consistent and entailed.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because "only gave Bill bananas" means no one else, including Ellen, received bananas, so not giving Ellen bananas is entailed by the first sentence.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
C  
Because "only gave Rob bananas" means Rob was the sole recipient of bananas, so giving them to Sue contradicts that.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because "only gave Bill bananas" excludes Mary from receiving bananas, so the second sentence is entailed.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because "only gave Ellen grapes" means no one else, including Rob, received grapes, so the second sentence is entailed.
