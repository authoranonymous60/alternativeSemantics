You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave bananas to Rob, then it's entailed that Sam didn't give bananas to Tom.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the focus is on giving Tom grapes, and it doesn’t say anything about whether Sam gave Tom oranges, making the statements independent.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because S1 says Sue only got oranges, but S2 says Sue also got apples, contradicting the exclusivity stated in S1.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because if bananas were only given to Sue, then Rob didn’t get any, so S2 is entailed by S1.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave Tom ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because if Tom only got oranges, it follows that he didn’t get bananas, so S2 is entailed by S1.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because if Sue only got apples, then Sue didn’t get oranges, so S2 is directly entailed by S1.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sue only got grapes, then Sue didn’t get apples, so S2 is entailed by S1.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because S1 says Ellen only got oranges, while S2 says Ellen also got bananas, which contradicts the exclusivity in S1.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if Mary only got grapes, then she didn’t get apples, so S2 is entailed by S1.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
B  
Because S1 is about Bill receiving only oranges, while S2 is about Mary also getting oranges. These are about different people, so the statements are independent.
