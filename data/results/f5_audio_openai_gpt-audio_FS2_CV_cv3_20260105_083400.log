--- Attempt 1 for f5_cv3 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because S1 states that Ellen only received grapes, but S2 contradicts that by saying Ellen received oranges as well.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because S1 makes a statement only about Ellen, and S2 adds new information about Rob, so the sentences are independent.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because if Mary only received oranges, it logically follows that she didn’t receive bananas or anything else, so S2 is entailed by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
B  
Because S1 is about what Mary received, and S2 introduces information about Tom. The two statements don’t contradict or entail each other.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because S1 is about Mary’s oranges, and S2 is about Tom. The statements are independent since they concern different individuals’ outcomes.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because S1 says Mary only received grapes, and S2 contradicts that by saying she also received apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because S1 is about Sue receiving apples, and S2 is about Mary. It’s new information that doesn’t contradict or follow from S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because S1 says Bill only received oranges, but S2 contradicts that by saying Bill also received bananas.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because S1 says Ellen only received bananas, and S2 contradicts that by saying she also received grapes.

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because if Tom only received bananas, it follows that he didn’t receive oranges or anything else.
