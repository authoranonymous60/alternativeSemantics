You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," which means Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else, but it does not restrict what else Sam gave Ellen. S2 says Sam gave Ellen something else (grapes), which contradicts the presupposition that bananas were the only thing given to her.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Mary oranges, which does not conflict with S1 and fits into the idea that the only thing Mary received from Sam was apples.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM," which means Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else. S2 talks about Tom receiving apples, which is unrelated to the restriction about who got bananas, so they are independent.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary grapes.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Mary grapes, which does not conflict or confirm the focus on apples. So they are independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning Sam gave Mary nothing else besides oranges. S2 says Sam didn’t give Mary apples, which fully aligns with the idea that oranges were all she received, so S2 is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave MARY apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else. S2 introduces that Mary also got apples, which directly contradicts the exclusivity expressed in S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave TOM apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else. S2 says that Tom also received apples, which directly contradicts S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ORANGES," meaning oranges were the only thing given to Rob. S2 says Sam didn’t give Rob bananas, which aligns perfectly with S1 as it reinforces that Rob didn’t get anything else.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning no one else received grapes. S2 says Rob also got grapes, which directly contradicts the exclusivity in S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB bananas.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "grapes," meaning grapes were the only thing Sam gave to Rob. S2 says Sam also gave Rob bananas, which contradicts this exclusivity, so they are contradicted.
