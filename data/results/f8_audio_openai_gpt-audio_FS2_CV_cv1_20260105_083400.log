--- Attempt 1 for f8_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB bananas.  
C  
Because the word "only" with prosodic focus on "ELLEN" means that Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else. S2 contradicts this by stating that Sam also gave bananas to Rob.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB ORANGES.  
C  
Because the focus is on "ROB GRAPES," meaning he only gave Rob grapes and nothing else to Rob. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave Rob oranges.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave BILL apples.  
C  
Because the focus on "TOM" means Sam gave apples only to Tom and not to anyone else. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam gave apples to Bill as well.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave MARY bananas.  
C  
Because the focus on "MARY APPLES" means that Mary only got apples and nothing else. S2 contradicts this by stating that Mary also got bananas.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave SUE oranges.  
C  
Because "ELLEN ORANGES" with focus means Ellen was the only recipient of oranges. S2 contradicts this by saying Sue also received oranges.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ROB apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, it is entailed that Sam did not give Rob any apples or anything else. S2 aligns with that, confirming no apples were given.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ELLEN bananas.  
B  
Because the statement about Bill receiving only bananas doesn’t entail any information about Ellen. S2 is independent since Ellen isn’t mentioned in S1 at all.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave SUE bananas.  
C  
Because with the prosodic focus on "ROB BANANAS," the meaning is that Rob was the sole recipient of bananas. S2 contradicts this by stating Sue also got bananas.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give MARY bananas.  
A  
Because "BILL BANANAS" means only Bill received bananas. It logically follows that no one else, including Mary, received bananas. So S2 is entailed.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ROB grapes.  
A  
Because the focused phrase "ELLEN GRAPES" means only Ellen received grapes. It follows that Rob didn’t receive grapes, making S2 an entailment.
