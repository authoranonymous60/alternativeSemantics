You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

9

Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference.  You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.

0  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave TOM apples, that implies he didn't give Tom anything else, so giving Tom grapes contradicts this.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Mary BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
B  
Because the focus is on Mary getting only bananas, but nothing is said about Bill, so the statements are independent.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave MARY apples, it means he didn’t give her anything else. Giving her bananas contradicts this.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
B  
Because the focus is on Sue receiving only apples, and there's no connection to what Rob got, making the statements independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave BILL bananas, it means he didn’t give Bill anything else, so giving Bill grapes contradicts this.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave ROB grapes, then he gave no other fruits to Rob, which entails he didn’t give Rob apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave SUE grapes, it means he didn’t give grapes to anyone else, so giving Tom grapes contradicts this.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave ELLEN grapes, he didn’t give grapes to anyone else, which entails that Rob didn’t get grapes.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave MARY grapes, this implies he gave her nothing else, so giving her bananas contradicts this.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave SUE apples, then no one else received apples, which entails Bill didn’t get any apples.
