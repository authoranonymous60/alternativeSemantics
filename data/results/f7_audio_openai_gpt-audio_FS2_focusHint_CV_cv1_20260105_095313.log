You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave bananas to Bill and not to anyone else. This does not restrict what items Bill received. S2 says Sam also gave Bill grapes, which directly contradicts the logical focus: S1 doesn't exclude Bill from getting other items. Therefore, S2 contradicts S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave apples to Mary and not to anyone else. S2 states that someone else, Ellen, also received apples. This directly contradicts the focus-based meaning in S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "APPLES," meaning Sam gave Sue apples and not any other item. There’s no restriction on whether others received apples. S2 introduces that Tom also got apples, which does not change the exclusivity of what Sue received. Thus, it is independent.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill oranges.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave grapes to Bill and not anyone else. It does not rule out other items for Bill. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Bill oranges, which is independent information that does not affect the meaning of S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BILL," meaning Sam gave apples to Bill and not anyone else. S2 discusses what else Bill didn’t get, which is unrelated to the focus on who received apples. So it’s independent.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave apples to Sue and no one else received apples. It doesn’t restrict what Sue received other than apples. S2 states Sue didn’t get bananas, and given S1’s meaning, that is fully consistent and entailed.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave oranges to Ellen and no one else got oranges. S2 states that Tom didn’t get oranges, which aligns with that meaning. Therefore it is entailed.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "TOM," meaning Sam gave apples to Tom and not to anyone else. S2 confirms that Mary didn’t get apples, which is consistent with S1. Thus it is entailed.

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "TOM," meaning Sam gave apples to Tom and no one else got apples. S2 contradicts this by saying Bill also got apples. Hence it is contradicted.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "BANANAS," meaning Sam gave Sue bananas and didn’t give her anything else. This doesn’t restrict who else got bananas. S2 says Sam didn’t give Tom bananas. That follows logically from S1’s specification of Sue as the sole recipient of bananas. Therefore it is entailed.
