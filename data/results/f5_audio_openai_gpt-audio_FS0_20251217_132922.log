You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Your output must follow this structure:

Understood. I will now proceed by transcribing S1 and S2 from the given audio, marking prosodic focus in S1 using uppercase, and then classifying S2 relative to S1 (entailed, independent, or contradicted) with a corresponding explanation.

Let’s go step-by-step through each index.

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen ORANGES.  
C  
Because: In S1, the focus is on "ELLEN" and "grapes," meaning the only thing Sam gave Ellen was grapes. S2 says Sam also gave Ellen oranges, which contradicts the exclusivity implied in "only gave Ellen grapes."

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB apples.  
B  
Because: S1 focuses on "ELLEN" and apples, meaning Sam only gave apples to Ellen (considering the apples’ recipient). S2 introduces a different recipient, Rob, and doesn’t contradict or confirm what S1 states about Ellen. Therefore, they are independent.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary BANANAS.  
A  
Because: S1, with focus on "MARY" and "ORANGES," says oranges were the only thing Sam gave Mary. This implies Sam didn’t give Mary anything else (like bananas). S2 states explicitly that Sam didn’t give Mary bananas. That’s consistent with and entailed by S1’s exclusivity.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave TOM oranges.  
B  
Because: The focus in S1 is on "MARY" and "ORANGES," meaning the only thing Sam gave to Mary was oranges. S2 is about what Sam gave Tom. There’s no conflict or confirmation between what was given to Mary and what was given to Tom. They’re about different recipients. So these are independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give TOM oranges.  
B  
Because: S1 focuses on "MARY" and "ORANGES"—the exclusivity is about what Mary got. It doesn’t specify anything about what Tom got. S2 specifies what Tom did not receive (oranges), but this doesn’t follow from or contradict S1. The statements are independent.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary APPLES.  
C  
Because: The focus in S1 is on "MARY" and "GRAPES," meaning grapes were the only thing Sam gave Mary. S2 says Sam also gave Mary apples, which directly contradicts the exclusive claim from S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave MARY apples.  
B  
Because: The focus in S1 is on "SUE" and "APPLES," meaning the only thing Sam gave Sue was apples. There’s no mention of Mary in S1, so S2, which talks about what Mary received, is a separate and unrelated fact. They are independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill BANANAS.  
C  
Because: The focus in S1 is on "BILL" and "ORANGES," meaning the only thing Bill received from Sam was oranges. S2 contradicts this by saying Bill also received bananas.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen GRAPES.  
C  
Because: The focus in S1 is on "ELLEN" and "BANANAS," meaning bananas were the only thing Sam gave Ellen. S2 contradicts that exclusivity by saying Sam also gave Ellen grapes.

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom ORANGES.  
A  
Because: The focus in S1 is on "TOM" and "BANANAS," meaning bananas were the only thing Sam gave Tom. This implies that Sam didn’t give Tom oranges or anything else. S2 explicitly confirms that Sam didn’t give Tom oranges, so it’s entailed by S1.
