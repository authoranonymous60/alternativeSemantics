You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
B  
Because S1 says Sam only gave grapes to Sue but does not mention Tom. S2 introduces Tom separately, making the statements independent.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because S1 says Ellen is the only one who got bananas, but S2 claims Mary also got bananas, which directly contradicts the exclusivity in S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because S1 specifies that Rob only received bananas, so the idea that Sam didn’t give Rob oranges is consistent with S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because S1 says Mary only got bananas and S2 says Mary also got apples, which contradicts the exclusivity of S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.  
B  
Because S1 only talks about Sue receiving oranges and says nothing about Rob at all, making S2 an independent statement. 

5  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because if Tom only received grapes, then it is naturally consistent that he didn’t get other fruits like oranges as well.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because S1 claims that only Bill got apples, while S2 contradicts this by saying Sue also got apples.

7  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because S1 says Sue only received apples, but S2 says she also got oranges, which contradicts the exclusivity implied in S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill oranges.  
B  
Because S1 speaks only about Rob and his oranges, while S2 is independent; it involves Bill, who was not mentioned in S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary bananas.  
B  
Because S1 mentions Tom and bananas, but it doesn’t say anything about Mary. S2 concerns Mary, so they are independent.
