You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Ellen," which means Sam did not give bananas to anyone else. But S2 says Sam also gave Rob bananas, directly contradicting that inference.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Rob," meaning Sam didn’t give anything else to Rob. S2 states Sam gave Rob oranges, which contradicts that inference.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Tom," meaning Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else. S2 says Sam also gave Bill apples, creating a contradiction.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on "apples," meaning Sam didn’t give anything else to Mary. S2 talks about bananas, which is a different item. Thus, S2 is independent of the inference about apples.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Ellen," meaning Sam didn’t give oranges to anyone else. S2 contradicts that by saying Sue also received oranges.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Rob," meaning Sam didn’t give anything else to Rob. S2 aligns with this by asserting Sam didn’t give Rob apples, making S2 entailed.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Bill," meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else. S2 is about Ellen and doesn’t follow from or contradict S1. It’s independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on "bananas," meaning Sam didn’t give anything else to Rob. S2 involves Sue, not Rob, so it’s independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary bananas.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Bill," meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else. S2 talks about Mary, so it’s unrelated and independent.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Ellen," meaning Sam didn’t give grapes to anyone else. S2 is about Rob and doesn’t contradict or follow from S1, so it’s independent.
