You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on “ELLEN,” meaning Sam only gave bananas to Ellen, not to anyone else. S2 says Sam also gave Ellen grapes, which contradicts the idea that the only thing given to Ellen was bananas.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on “APPLES,” meaning Sam gave only apples to Mary and nothing else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Mary oranges, which aligns with that focus—no other items besides apples were given to Mary.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on “TOM,” meaning Sam gave bananas to Tom and no one else. S2 says Tom also received apples, which contradicts the exclusivity of giving Tom only bananas.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on “APPLES,” so Sam gave only apples to Mary and nothing else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Mary grapes, which supports that focus—no other items besides apples were given.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave Mary ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on “ORANGES,” meaning Sam gave Mary only oranges and nothing else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Mary apples, confirming this exclusivity with respect to oranges.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on “ROB,” meaning only Rob got apples, and no one else did. S2 says Sam also gave Mary apples, which contradicts the exclusivity of S1.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on “ROB,” meaning only Rob received apples. S2 says Tom also received apples, which contradicts the exclusivity of Rob as the sole recipient.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on “ORANGES,” meaning Rob only received oranges and nothing else. S2 states that Rob didn’t get bananas, which supports the idea that Rob only received oranges.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on “BILL,” meaning only Bill received grapes. S2 says Rob also received grapes, which contradicts the exclusivity of S1.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on “GRAPES,” meaning Rob only got grapes and nothing else. S2 says Rob also got bananas, which contradicts the exclusivity of S1.
