You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on Ellen. That means Sam gave grapes only to Ellen and not to anyone else. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam didn’t give grapes to Tom.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen oranges.  
A  
Because the focus on "APPLES" means Sam only gave apples to Ellen and nothing else (no other fruit). Thus, it is entailed that Sam didn’t give her oranges.

2  
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
B  
Because the focus on "GRAPES" means Sam only gave grapes to Rob and did not give him anything else. It says nothing about whom else Sam may have given grapes to, so S2 is independent of S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
B  
Because the focus on "APPLES" means Sam only gave apples to Rob (and no other fruit to him). It doesn’t specify that others cannot get apples too, so S2 is independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
B  
Because the focus on "APPLES" means Sam only gave Ellen apples and not other items to her. This does not entail or contradict whether Sam gave apples to Bill, so S2 is independent.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus on "ROB" means Sam only gave apples to Rob and no one else. Therefore, it is entailed that he did not give Sue apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the focus on "ORANGES" means Sam only gave Rob oranges and nothing else. S2 says he also gave Rob apples, which directly contradicts the focus on oranges in S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the focus on "APPLES" means Sam only gave apples to Rob and nothing else. If Sam also gave him grapes, it contradicts that focus.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the focus on "ROB" means Sam only gave bananas to Rob and no one else. That entails that Ellen didn’t get bananas.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the focus on "MARY" means Sam only gave apples to Mary and no one else. If Sam also gave apples to Ellen, that contradicts the focus.
