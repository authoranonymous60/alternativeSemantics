You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "BILL," meaning Sam did not give bananas to anyone else, but it does not say that Bill couldn't receive other things. S2 says Bill also got grapes, which doesn't contradict the focus on the recipient. It contradicts the implied meaning that Bill only got bananas. Therefore, S2 contradicts the meaning of S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "MARY," meaning that Sam did not give apples to anyone else besides Mary. S2 says Sam also gave apples to Ellen, which directly contradicts the meaning of S1 that no one else got apples.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "SUE," meaning no one else besides Sue received apples. S2 says that Tom also received apples, which directly contradicts the meaning of S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "GRAPES," meaning Bill only received grapes and nothing else. S2 states that Bill didn't receive oranges. This is entailed by S1, as it reinforces that Bill did not get anything other than grapes.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "APPLES," meaning Bill only received apples and nothing else. S2 states that Bill didn’t get bananas. This is entailed by S1 because it supports the idea that Bill didn’t get anything other than apples.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "APPLES," meaning Sue only got apples and nothing else. S2 says Sue didn’t get bananas, which is entailed by S1, because it confirms Sue got no other items.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "ELLEN," meaning Sam gave oranges only to Ellen and no one else. S2 says Tom didn’t get oranges, which is entailed by S1, confirming no one else besides Ellen received oranges.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "TOM," meaning Sam gave apples only to Tom and no one else. S2 says Mary didn’t get apples, which is entailed by S1, confirming no one besides Tom received apples.

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "TOM," meaning only Tom received apples and no one else did. S2 says that Bill also got apples, which directly contradicts S1’s assertion.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave bananas only to Sue, and no one else received bananas. S2 says Tom didn’t get bananas, which is entailed by S1. It confirms that no one other than Sue got bananas.
