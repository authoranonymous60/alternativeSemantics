--- Attempt 1 for f4_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.
C
Because S1 says that Sue is the only person who received apples from Sam, but S2 contradicts that by stating that Rob also received apples, so the two statements conflict.

1
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.
A
Because if Sam only gave apples to Bill, that means Mary didn’t get apples. So S2 is entailed by S1.

2
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.
C
Because S1 says that Mary is the only person who received oranges, while S2 contradicts this by saying Ellen also received oranges.

3
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.
A
Because if Ellen is the only one who got apples, then Tom did not get apples, which makes S2 entailed by S1.

4
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.
B
Because S1 limits Sam’s giving of bananas to only Rob, but says nothing about oranges, so whether Sam gave oranges to Rob or not is independent of S1. Therefore, S2 is independent of S1.

5
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill grapes.
A
Because if Bill only got bananas, he didn’t get grapes. So S2 is entailed by S1.

6
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.
A
Because if Ellen only got oranges, she didn’t get grapes. So S2 is entailed by S1.

7
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.
B
Because S1 specifies only Mary got bananas, but says nothing about Ellen and bananas, so S2 is independent of S1.

8
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.
A
Because if only Bill got bananas, then Tom couldn’t have gotten any. So S2 is entailed by S1.

9
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.
A
Because if Sue only got oranges, she didn’t get grapes. So S2 is entailed by S1.
