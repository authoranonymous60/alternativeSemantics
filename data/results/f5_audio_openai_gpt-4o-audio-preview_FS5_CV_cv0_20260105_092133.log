--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Mary GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary grapes, that excludes the possibility of giving her anything else, like apples. The second statement contradicts the first.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because the first statement restricts Sue to apples, but it doesn't restrict what Sam gave to Mary. The second statement doesn't contradict or logically follow from the first, so they are independent.

2  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Bill oranges, that excludes the possibility of also giving him bananas. The second statement directly contradicts the first.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen bananas, that excludes the possibility of giving her any other fruit, such as grapes. The second statement contradicts the first.

4  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom bananas, that naturally means he did not give Tom oranges. The second statement is logically entailed by the first.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, that excludes giving him any other fruits, like apples. The second statement contradicts the first.

6  
S1: Sam only gave LISA grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Lisa bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Lisa grapes, that means he didn’t give her any other fruit, including bananas. The second statement is entailed by the first.

7  
S1: Sam only gave JOHN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because the first statement is about what John received, and the second statement is about what Mary received. The two don't logically connect, so they are independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ANN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ann grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ann oranges, then he would not have given her grapes. The second statement is fully entailed by the first.

9  
S1: Sam only gave DAN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Dan oranges.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Dan apples, that excludes giving him any other fruits like oranges. The second statement contradicts the first.
