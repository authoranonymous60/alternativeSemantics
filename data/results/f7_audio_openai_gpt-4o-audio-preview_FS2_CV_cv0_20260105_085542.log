--- Attempt 1 for f7_cv0 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Bill BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Bill bananas, then he did not give him grapes. The second sentence contradicts this by saying he gave Bill grapes as well.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, then he didn’t give apples to anyone else. The second sentence contradicts this by saying that he also gave apples to Ellen.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Sue apples, then he didn’t give apples to anyone else. The second sentence contradicts this by saying he also gave apples to Tom.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill grapes, then it naturally follows that he didn’t give him anything else, including oranges. The second sentence is consistent with that.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill apples, then he didn’t give him anything else, including bananas. The second sentence is consistent with that.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue apples, then he didn’t give her bananas or any other fruit. The second sentence is consistent with that.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the fact that Sam only gave Ellen oranges doesn’t provide any information about whether or not he gave Tom oranges. The two sentences are independent of each other.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom apples, then he didn’t give apples to anyone else, including Mary. The second sentence is consistent with that.

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Tom apples, then he didn’t give apples to anyone else. The second sentence contradicts this by saying he also gave apples to Bill.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue bananas, then he didn’t give bananas to anyone else, including Tom. The second sentence is consistent with that.
