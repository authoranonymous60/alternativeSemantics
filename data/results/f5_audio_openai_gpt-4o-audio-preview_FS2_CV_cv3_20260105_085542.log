--- Attempt 1 for f5_cv3 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the focus "only" on "ELLEN" limits the set of items Sam gave Ellen to grapes. If Sam also gave her oranges, it contradicts the initial statement.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the focus "only" on "ELLEN" means no one else got apples. If Rob also received apples, it contradicts the first statement.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the focus "only" on "MARY" and "oranges" implies no other fruit was given to Mary, so not giving her bananas is consistent with the first sentence.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
C  
Because the focus "only" on "MARY" means no one else was given oranges. If Tom also got oranges, it contradicts the first statement.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the focus "only" on "MARY" for oranges means no one else was given oranges, so not giving Tom oranges is consistent with that.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus "only" on "MARY" and "grapes" means no other items were given to Mary. If she also received apples, that contradicts the first statement.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus "only" on "SUE" for apples means no one else got apples. If Mary also got apples, that contradicts the first statement.

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because the focus "only" on "BILL" for oranges means Bill didn’t get any other fruit. If he also got bananas, it contradicts the first statement.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus "only" on "ELLEN" and "bananas" means Ellen only received bananas. If she also got grapes, it contradicts the first statement.

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the focus "only" on "TOM" and "bananas" means Tom only got bananas. Not giving Tom oranges aligns with that.
