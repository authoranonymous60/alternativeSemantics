You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because S1 emphasizes that only Bill received grapes, so S2 contradicts that by saying Sue also received them.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because S1 emphasizes that only Sue received oranges, and S2 contradicts this by saying Rob also received oranges.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because if only Sue got grapes, it is entailed that Ellen did not receive grapes.

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if only Tom got apples, it means Tom didn’t get anything else, including grapes.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because S1 states that Rob only got oranges, and S2 contradicts it by saying he also got apples.

S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if only Sue got grapes, it is entailed that Tom didn’t get grapes.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because S1 emphasizes that only Ellen received bananas, so S2 contradicts this by saying Mary also got bananas.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because if only Rob received bananas, that means he did not receive oranges, which matches S2.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because S1 says Mary only got bananas, and S2 contradicts that by saying Mary also got apples.

S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because if only Sue received oranges, it implies that Rob did not receive any oranges.
