You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on Ellen, which means the statement entails that Sam gave grapes to Ellen and nobody else. Therefore, it also follows that Sam didn’t give grapes to Tom (or anyone else), which makes S2 entailed by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on Ellen, meaning Sam gave apples only to Ellen and no one else. If S2 says Sam didn’t give Ellen apples, that directly contradicts S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on Rob, meaning Sam gave grapes only to Rob and not to anyone else. If S2 says that Sam also gave Ellen grapes, that contradicts S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on Rob, meaning Sam gave apples only to Rob and not anyone else. If S2 says Sam also gave apples to Ellen, this contradicts S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because the focus on Ellen in S1 means Sam gave apples only to Ellen, which implies he didn’t give apples to anyone else, including Bill. Therefore S2 is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on Rob, meaning Sam gave apples only to Rob, and by implication, he didn’t give apples to Sue or anyone else. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on Rob for oranges, meaning Sam only gave oranges to Rob and not any other person. However, it doesn’t restrict what else Sam might have given Rob. Therefore, S2 talks about apples and is independent of S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on Rob in relation to apples, meaning Sam only gave apples to Rob and not to others. But it doesn’t restrict what else Sam might have given Rob. Therefore, S2 talks about grapes and is independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on Rob when it comes to bananas, meaning Sam gave bananas only to Rob and no one else. Therefore, S2 is entailed because Sam didn’t give bananas to Ellen.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on Mary, meaning Sam gave apples only to Mary. So if S2 says Sam also gave apples to Ellen, that contradicts S1.
