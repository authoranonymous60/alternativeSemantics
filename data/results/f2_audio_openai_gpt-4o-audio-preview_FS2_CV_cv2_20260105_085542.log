--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because "only gave ROB" implies exclusivity for Rob, so it follows that Tom didn’t receive bananas.

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the statement about grapes doesn’t necessarily entail anything about oranges.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because "only gave SUE oranges" contradicts any statement about also giving her apples.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because "only gave SUE bananas" means no one else received bananas, so Rob didn’t get them.

4  
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because "only gave TOM oranges" entails that Tom didn’t receive any other fruit, including bananas.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because "only gave SUE apples" means Sue didn’t get any fruit besides apples, so no oranges.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because "only gave SUE grapes" means Sue didn’t receive any other fruit, so no apples.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because "only gave ELLEN oranges" contradicts giving her something else, like bananas.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because "only gave MARY grapes" means Mary didn’t get any other fruit, so no apples.

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
B  
Because "only gave BILL oranges" speaks about Bill’s exclusivity, not about Mary’s fruit, so they are independent.
