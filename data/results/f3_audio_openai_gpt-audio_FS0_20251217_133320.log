--- Attempt 1 for f3 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Your output must follow this structure:

S1: ...
S2: ...

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference.  You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.

Understood. I will begin performing the semantic classification task by transcribing the audio, marking prosodic focus, and classifying S2 relative to S1.

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave ELLEN grapes, it entails that Sam didn’t give anyone else grapes, including Tom.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave ELLEN APPLES, it entails that Sam did give Ellen apples, so saying that Sam didn’t give Ellen apples is contradicted.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave ROB grapes, it entails that Sam didn’t give anyone else grapes, so saying that he also gave Ellen grapes is contradicted.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave ROB APPLES, it entails that Sam didn’t give anyone else apples, so saying that he also gave Ellen apples is contradicted.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave ELLEN apples, it entails that Sam didn’t give anyone else apples, including Bill.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave ROB apples, it entails that Sam didn’t give anyone else apples, including Sue.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the focus on ORANGES entails that Sam didn’t give Rob anything else besides oranges, so saying Sam also gave Rob apples is independent and doesn’t follow from or contradict the first sentence.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave ROB APPLES, it entails that he didn’t give Rob anything else, so saying he also gave Rob grapes is contradicted.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave ROB bananas, it entails that he didn’t give anyone else bananas, including Ellen.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave MARY apples, it entails that he didn’t give anyone else apples, so saying he also gave Ellen apples is contradicted.
