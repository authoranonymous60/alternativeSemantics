--- Attempt 1 for f3_cv2 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.
B
Because... S1 only specifies who Sam gave grapes to, not who he didn't give grapes to, so S2 is independent.

1
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen apples.
C
Because... S1 entails that Sam gave Ellen apples and nothing else to Ellen, so S2 contradicts S1.

2
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
C
Because... S1 entails that Sam gave grapes only to Rob, so S2 contradicts S1.

3
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.
C
Because... S1 entails that Sam gave apples only to Rob, so S2 contradicts S1.

4
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.
B
Because... S1 only specifies who Sam gave apples to, not who he didn't give apples to, so S2 is independent.

5
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.
B
Because... S1 only specifies who Sam gave apples to, not who he didn't give apples to, so S2 is independent.

6
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.
B
Because... S1 entails that Sam gave oranges only to Rob, but it doesn't say anything about what else Rob received, so S2 is independent.

7
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.
B
Because... S1 entails that Sam gave apples only to Rob, but it doesn't say anything about what else Rob received, so S2 is independent.

8
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.
B
Because... S1 only specifies who Sam gave bananas to, not who he didn't give bananas to, so S2 is independent.

9
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.
C
Because... S1 entails that Sam gave apples only to Mary, so S2 contradicts S1.
