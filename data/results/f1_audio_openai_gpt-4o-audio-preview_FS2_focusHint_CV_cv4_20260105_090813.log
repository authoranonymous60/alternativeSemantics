You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because by focusing on "BILL," the sentence means that Sam gave grapes only to Bill and no one else. But S2 says Sam also gave grapes to Sue, which contradicts S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because by focusing on "SUE," S1 means Sam gave oranges only to Sue and not to anyone else. S2 contradicts this by stating Sam also gave oranges to Rob.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because when the focus is on "SUE," S1 means Sam gave grapes only to Sue and no one else. Saying Sam didn’t give grapes to Ellen is consistent with that meaning.

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
B  
Because focusing on "TOM" means Sam only gave apples to Tom and nothing else to Tom specifically. The fact that he didn't give Tom grapes is a separate piece of information, so they are independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because by focusing on "ROB," S1 means Sam gave oranges only to Rob and not anything else to him. S2 says he also gave Rob apples, which contradicts the focus on exclusivity.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because by focusing on "SUE," S1 means Sam gave grapes only to Sue and no one else. S2 states that Tom didn't receive any grapes, which supports that exclusive focus.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because focusing on "ELLEN" means Sam gave bananas only to Ellen but nobody else. S2 says Sam also gave bananas to Mary, which contradicts S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because focusing on "ROB" means Sam gave bananas only to Rob and nothing else to him. The fact that he didn’t give Rob oranges aligns with that limitation.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "MARY" means Sam gave bananas only to Mary and nothing else to her. S2 states that he gave Mary apples too, which contradicts that exclusivity.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because focusing on "ORANGES" means Sam only gave oranges to Sue and nothing else to Sue. The fact that he didn’t give Rob any oranges doesn’t contradict this and is entailed by the statement.
