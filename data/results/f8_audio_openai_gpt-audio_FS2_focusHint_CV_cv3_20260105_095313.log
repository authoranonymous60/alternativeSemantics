You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

--- Raw Model Output ---

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the focus is on ELLEN, meaning Sam didn't give bananas to anyone else. S2 says Sam also gave Rob bananas, which contradicts S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because the focus is on ROB receiving grapes and nothing else. S2 says Rob also got oranges, contradicting S1’s restriction.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because the focus is on TOM, meaning Sam gave apples to no one else. S2 says Bill also received apples, which is a contradiction.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
B  
Because the focus is on apples. S1 means Mary only got apples (not other items), but S2 says Mary also got bananas, which is independent of who else was given apples—it’s about what Mary received.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because the focus is on ELLEN, meaning Sam didn’t give oranges to anyone else. S2 says Sue also got oranges, which contradicts S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the focus is on ROB, meaning Sam gave oranges to Rob and nothing else to him. S2 says Rob didn’t get apples, which aligns with S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on BILL, meaning no one else got bananas. S2 that Ellen didn’t get bananas is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
C  
Because the focus is on ROB, meaning no one else got bananas. S2 says Sue also got bananas, which contradicts S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on BILL, meaning no one else got bananas. S2 confirms no bananas were given to Mary, which is entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on ELLEN, meaning no one else got grapes. S2 says Rob didn’t get grapes, which aligns perfectly with S1.
