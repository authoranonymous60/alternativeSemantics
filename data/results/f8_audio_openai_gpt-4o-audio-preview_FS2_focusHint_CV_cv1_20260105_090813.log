--- Attempt 1 for f8_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen bananas, that means he did not give anyone else bananas. Thus, the statement that he also gave Rob bananas contradicts S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, that means he gave Rob no other fruit. Therefore, the claim that he also gave Rob oranges contradicts S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Tom apples, that means he did not give apples to anyone else. The statement that he also gave Bill apples contradicts S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, that means he gave her no other fruit. The statement that he also gave Mary bananas contradicts S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen oranges, that means he did not give oranges to anyone else. The statement that he also gave Sue oranges contradicts S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, it follows that he did not give Rob anything else, including apples. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill bananas, that means he did not give bananas to anyone else, including Ellen. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob bananas, that means he did not give bananas to anyone else. The statement that he also gave Sue bananas contradicts S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Bill bananas, then he did not give bananas to anyone else, including Mary. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, that means he did not give grapes to anyone else, including Rob. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.
