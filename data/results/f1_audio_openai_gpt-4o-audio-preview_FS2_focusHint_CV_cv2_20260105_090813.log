You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because with the focus on "Bill," S1 means Sam gave grapes only to Bill. S2 says Sam also gave grapes to Sue, which contradicts S1.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because with the focus on "Sue," S1 means Sam gave oranges only to Sue. S2 says Sam also gave oranges to Rob, which contradicts S1.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because with the focus on "Sue," S1 means Sam gave grapes only to Sue. S2 says Sam didn't give grapes to Ellen, which is consistent with S1, so it’s entailed.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because with the focus on "Tom," S1 means Sam gave apples only to Tom. There's no mention of grapes, so S2—stating he didn't give Tom grapes—aligns with S1, making it entailed.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because with the focus on "Rob," S1 means Sam gave oranges only to Rob. S2 says Sam also gave Rob apples, which contradicts S1 because it means Sam gave Rob something else besides oranges.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because with the focus on "Sue," S1 means Sam gave grapes only to Sue. S2, which says that he didn't give Tom grapes, is consistent because it does not violate S1’s meaning.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because with the focus on "Ellen," S1 means Sam gave bananas only to Ellen. S2 says he also gave bananas to Mary, which contradicts S1.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because with the focus on "Rob," S1 means Sam gave bananas only to Rob. There’s no mention of oranges in S1, so S2—stating he didn’t give Rob oranges—is consistent with S1.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because with the focus on "Mary," S1 means Sam gave bananas only to Mary. S2 says Sam also gave Mary apples, which contradicts S1 because it adds something else given to Mary besides bananas.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because with the focus on "Sue," S1 means Sam gave oranges only to Sue. S2, which states that Sam didn't give Rob oranges, is consistent and entailed by S1.
