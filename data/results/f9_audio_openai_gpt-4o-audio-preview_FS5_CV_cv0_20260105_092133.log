You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because the first sentence focuses on Rob receiving apples exclusively, while the second sentence talks about Mary also receiving apples. These statements are separate in terms of focus, so they are independent and do not confirm or contradict each other.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
B  
Because the first sentence states that only Rob received apples, which implies he did not give apples to anyone else, not even Tom. The second sentence says he also gave apples to Tom, which introduces information that creates a contradiction. However, since the focus in S1 is on ROB and not on exclusion of others directly, they can initially seem independent.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, then it logically follows that he did not give Rob anything else, including bananas. Therefore, the second sentence is entailed by the first.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the first sentence states that only Bill received grapes, which excludes the possibility of anyone else, like Rob, receiving grapes. The second sentence states that Rob also got grapes, contradicting the first statement.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
B  
Because the first sentence concerns only grapes, indicating exclusivity in what Rob received, and the second sentence introduces a different item (bananas). Since the focus is on grapes, any mention of bananas is a separate matter and does not contradict what is stated about grapes—making the statements independent.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the first sentence claims that only Mary received apples, which excludes any other person from getting apples. The second sentence states that Ellen also got apples, which directly contradicts the exclusivity claimed in the first sentence.

6  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because if only Mary received apples, then no one else, including Tom, could have received apples. The second sentence contradicts this exclusivity.

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary bananas, then he did not give her any other fruits, including apples. The second sentence logically follows from that, so it is entailed.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because if the only thing Sam gave Rob was oranges, then Rob did not receive anything else, including bananas. The second sentence is therefore entailed by the first.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
B  
Because the first sentence focuses on the fact that the only thing Rob received was grapes. The second sentence introduces a different fruit (bananas), which is not directly related to the focus on grapes in S1. Thus, they describe independent events and do not contradict or confirm each other directly.
