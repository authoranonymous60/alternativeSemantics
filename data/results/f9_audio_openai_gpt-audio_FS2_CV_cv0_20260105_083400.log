--- Attempt 1 for f9_cv0 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because S1 states that the only thing Sam gave Ellen was bananas, and S2 contradicts this by stating Sam gave Ellen something else (grapes).

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, then it's entailed that Sam didn't give her oranges or anything else.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because S1 says bananas were the only thing given to Tom, while S2 contradicts this by saying Tom also got apples.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because if the only thing Sam gave Mary was apples, then it follows logically that Sam didn’t give her grapes either.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if the only thing Sam gave Mary was oranges, then Sam did not give her apples—this is logically entailed.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because S1 states what was given to Rob, and S2 talks about what was given to Mary. The statements are about different individuals and do not contradict or entail each other.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
B  
Because S1 is about what Sam gave Rob, and S2 mentions what Sam gave Tom. These are about different people and do not necessarily contradict or entail each other.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, it logically follows that Sam didn’t give Rob bananas or anything else besides oranges.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because S1 is about what was given to Bill, and S2 is about what was given to Rob. These statements don’t entail or contradict each other since they refer to distinct individuals.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because S1 states that grapes were the only thing given to Rob, while S2 contradicts that by saying Rob also received bananas.
