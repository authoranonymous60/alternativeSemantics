You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Ellen," meaning Sam did not give grapes to anyone else. S2 states that Sam gave Ellen something else (oranges), which contradicts the focus-based entailment that grapes were the only thing Sam gave Ellen.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Ellen," meaning Sam gave apples to no one else except Ellen. S2 says Sam also gave apples to Rob, which contradicts this entailment.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Mary," meaning the only person who got oranges was Mary and she got no other item. S2 says Mary didn't get bananas, which is consistent with the entailment.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Mary," meaning that Mary is the only recipient of oranges. S2 says that Tom also received oranges, which contradicts this entailment.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Mary," meaning no one else received oranges. S2 says that Tom didn’t get oranges, which is consistent with the entailment that only Mary got oranges.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "grapes," meaning that grapes were the only thing Mary received. S2 says that Mary also got apples, contradicting the entailment.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Sue," meaning Sue is the only person who got apples. S2 says that Mary also received apples, which contradicts this entailment.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "oranges," meaning oranges were the only thing Bill received. S2 says that Bill also got bananas, contradicting this entailment.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "bananas," meaning bananas were the only thing Ellen received. S2 says Ellen also got grapes, contradicting this entailment.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Tom," meaning Tom is the only person who got bananas. S2 states that Tom didn’t receive oranges, which does not contradict the entailment and supports it.
