You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Ellen," meaning Sam didn’t give anyone else bananas. Since S2 says Sam gave Ellen another item (grapes), this contradicts the exclusivity implied by "only" with focus on Ellen.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "apples," meaning Sam didn’t give Mary anything other than apples. S2 is entailed because it states that Mary didn’t receive oranges, which supports that apples were the only fruit given to Mary.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Tom," meaning Sam did not give anyone else bananas. The second sentence, however, says he gave Tom apples in addition to bananas, which contradicts the exclusivity implied by "only" if the focus is on Tom.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "apples," meaning Mary didn’t get anything else. The second sentence is entailed because it matches the exclusivity by stating Mary didn’t get grapes.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Mary ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "oranges," meaning Mary didn’t receive anything other than oranges. The second sentence supports that by declaring she didn’t get apples, so it’s entailed.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Rob," meaning Sam didn’t give anyone else apples. However, the second sentence states that Mary also received apples. This is independent because it provides information about Mary, not about Rob’s exclusivity regarding the apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Rob," meaning that Sam didn’t give anyone else apples. The second sentence contradicts this by saying Sam also gave Tom apples, breaking the exclusivity of Rob being the only one receiving apples.

7  
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "oranges," which means Rob didn’t receive anything else besides oranges. The second sentence aligns with that, confirming that Rob didn't get bananas, so it’s entailed.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Bill," meaning Sam didn’t give anyone else grapes. The second sentence contradicts that by saying Rob also got grapes.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on "Rob," meaning that he was the only person who got grapes. The second sentence is independent since it talks about bananas, which isn’t relevant to the exclusivity of Rob getting grapes.
