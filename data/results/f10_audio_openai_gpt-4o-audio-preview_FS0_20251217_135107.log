0  
S1: Sam ONLY gave Tom apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because S2 contradicts S1 by stating that Tom received more than just apples.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Mary BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.  
B  
Because S2 is independent of S1. Mary's gifts do not imply anything about what Bill received.

2  
S1: Sam only GAVE Mary apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because S2 contradicts S1 by claiming that Mary received more than just apples.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Sue APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
B  
Because S2 is independent of S1. Sue receiving apples does not affect whether Rob did or did not get apples.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because S2 contradicts S1 by showing that Bill received more than just bananas.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because S2 is entailed by S1. If Rob only got grapes, then he did not get apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave Sue GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because S2 contradicts S1, which implies Sue was the only person given grapes.

7  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because S2 is entailed by S1. If Ellen was the only person who got grapes, then Rob must not have gotten any grapes.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because S2 contradicts S1, which claims Mary only received grapes.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Sue APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because S2 is entailed by S1. If only Sue got apples, then Bill could not have gotten apples.
