--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.
S2: Sam also gave ROB apples.
C
Because S1 says Sue was the only recipient of apples, but S2 says Rob also received apples, which contradicts that exclusivity.

1
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.
S2: Sam didn’t give MARY apples.
A
Because S1 says Bill was the only one who received apples, which is consistent with S2 saying Mary did not receive any apples.

2
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.
S2: Sam also gave ELLEN oranges.
C
Because S1 says Mary was the only one who received oranges, but S2 says Ellen also received oranges, directly contradicting S1.

3
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.
S2: Sam didn’t give TOM apples.
A
Because S1 says Ellen was the only one who received apples, and S2 confirms that Tom did not receive apples, which aligns with that exclusivity.

4
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam also gave ROB oranges.
B
Because S1 is about bananas, stating Rob was the only recipient of them, and S2 is about oranges, a different fruit, so they are independent facts.

5
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.
S2: Sam didn’t give BILL grapes.
A
Because S1 says Bill was only given bananas, so S2 saying Bill didn’t get grapes is entailed by that exclusivity.

6
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.
S2: Sam didn’t give ELLEN grapes.
A
Because if Ellen only got oranges, this entails she didn’t get grapes or anything else.

7
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.
S2: Sam didn’t give ELLEN bananas.
B
Because S1 talks about what Mary received (bananas only), and S2 speaks about Ellen not receiving bananas, which is a separate, independent fact.

8
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.
S2: Sam didn’t give TOM bananas.
A
Because if Bill was the only person to get bananas, that entails no one else, including Tom, got bananas.

9
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.
S2: Sam didn’t give SUE grapes.
A
Because if Sue only got oranges, it’s entailed that she didn’t get grapes or any other fruit, so S2 is directly supported by S1.
