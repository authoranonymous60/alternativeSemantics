You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Understood. I’m ready to proceed. I can transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio you provide, mark the prosodic focus in S1 using uppercase, and classify the relationship of S2 to S1 as entailed (A), independent (B), or contradicted (C) with reasoning.

Please provide the audio for the first set of S1 and S2.

--- Raw Model Output ---

Understood. You’ve provided a list of sentences, each involving who Sam gave certain items to and sometimes what Sam did not give to others. Now, I need to transcribe S1 and S2 from audio for each index, mark prosodic focus in S1 using uppercase, and classify S2 relative to S1. 

Please provide the audio for the sentences so I can proceed with the transcription and analysis. Once the audio is available, I'll follow the structure exactly and deliver the results accordingly.

I currently need audio input to proceed with the semantic classification task. You can provide the required audio containing S1 and S2 sentences, and I will transcribe, mark prosodic focus, and classify them accordingly.

Please share the audio so we can begin.
