You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:

2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:

   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.
