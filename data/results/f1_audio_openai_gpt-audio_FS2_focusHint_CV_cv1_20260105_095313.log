You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on BILL, meaning Sam only gave grapes to Bill and no one else. S2 states that Sam also gave Sue grapes, which contradicts the focus-based entailment that Bill is the only recipient of grapes.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on SUE, which means Sam gave oranges only to Sue and no one else. S2 says Sam also gave Rob oranges, directly contradicting the focus-based entailment.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on SUE, implying Sue is the only one who got grapes. That entails Sam did not give grapes to Ellen or anyone else. So S2 is entailed by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on TOM, meaning Tom is the only one who got apples. S2 talks about grapes, a different item, not apples. So the statements are independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on ROB, meaning Rob is the only one who got oranges and nothing else. S2 says Sam also gave Rob apples, which contradicts the focus-based entailment that he didn’t receive other items.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on SUE, meaning she is the only one who got grapes. This entails that Tom did not get grapes. So S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on ELLEN, meaning Ellen is the only one who got bananas. S2 says Sam also gave Mary bananas, which contradicts this entailment.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on ROB, meaning Rob only received bananas and no other items. This entails that Rob did not receive oranges. So S2 is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on MARY, meaning Mary only received bananas and no other items. S2 states that Mary also got apples, contradicting that entailment.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on SUE, meaning she is the only person who received oranges. S2 states something about Rob not getting oranges. While S1 entails Sue is the only recipient of oranges, it doesn’t directly entail whether Rob did or didn’t get oranges, so S2 is independent.
