You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

--- Raw Model Output ---

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
B  
Because the second sentence talks about grapes, which is a new piece of information that is independent of the focus on bananas in the first sentence.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the focus in the first sentence is that Mary is the only person who received apples, but the second sentence says Ellen also received apples, which contradicts the first statement.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the first sentence focuses on Sue being the only recipient of apples, but the second sentence says Tom also got apples, contradicting the first statement.

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because if Bill only received grapes, it follows logically that he didn’t receive oranges.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because if the only thing Bill received was apples, it means that Bill did not get bananas, so the second sentence is entailed by the first.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because if Sue only got apples, she did not receive bananas. So the second sentence is entailed by the first.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because the first sentence is about Ellen and the second sentence is about Tom, the two statements are independent of each other.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if Tom is the only person who received apples, then Mary clearly did not receive any apples. The second sentence follows from the first.

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because the first sentence states that Tom is the only recipient of apples, but the second sentence says Bill was also given apples, which contradicts the first statement.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because if Sue is the only one who received bananas, it follows that Tom did not receive bananas. The second sentence is entailed by the first.
