You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.
A
Because...

9
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on ELLEN, so it entails that Sam did not give grapes to anyone else besides Ellen. The statement that Sam didn’t give Tom grapes is consistent with that, and is therefore entailed by S1.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on ELLEN, it means Sam gave apples to Ellen but not to anyone else. S2 contradicts this by saying that Sam didn’t give Ellen apples at all.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on ROB, it means Sam gave grapes only to Rob and not to anyone else. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave grapes to Ellen.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on ROB, it entails that Sam gave apples only to Rob and no one else. S2 contradicts this by saying he also gave apples to Ellen.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on ELLEN, it means Sam gave apples only to Ellen and no one else. S2 is consistent with this by stating that Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on ROB, it means Sam gave apples only to Rob and no one else. S2 is consistent with this by saying Sam didn’t give apples to Sue.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on ROB, it means Sam gave oranges to Rob but not to anyone else. It says nothing about what else Rob might have received. S2 talks about a different item, apples, so it is independent.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on ROB, it means Sam gave apples only to Rob and not to anyone else. It does not limit what else Rob might have received. S2 introduces grapes, which makes it independent.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on ROB, it means Sam gave bananas only to Rob and no one else. Therefore, S2 is entailed since it says Sam didn’t give bananas to Ellen.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on MARY, it means Sam gave apples only to Mary and not to anyone else. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave apples to Ellen.
