--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.

9
S1: Sam only gave Sue ORANGES.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob oranges.

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Bill grapes, then he did not give grapes to anyone else, so giving them to Sue contradicts that statement.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Sue oranges, then he didn’t give oranges to anyone else, so giving them to Rob contradicts that statement.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue grapes, then by implication he did not give grapes to anyone else, including Ellen, so S2 is entailed by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom apples, it means he did not give Tom anything else, including grapes, so S2 is entailed by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, then giving him apples contradicts that exclusivity.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue grapes, it implies he gave no one else grapes, including Tom, so S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen bananas, then giving them to Mary contradicts the exclusivity.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob bananas, it means he did not give Rob anything else, including oranges, so S2 is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Mary bananas, then giving her apples contradicts that exclusivity.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue oranges, it entails that no one else, including Rob, got oranges.
