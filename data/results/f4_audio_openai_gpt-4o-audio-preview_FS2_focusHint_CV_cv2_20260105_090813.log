You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Sue," meaning Sam only gave apples to Sue and not to anyone else. S2 states that Sam also gave apples to Rob, which contradicts the focus in S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Bill," meaning Sam only gave apples to Bill and not anyone else. S2 talks about Mary and whether she got apples, which is independent of S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is "Mary," meaning Sam didn’t give oranges to anyone else. S2 states that Sam also gave oranges to Ellen, which contradicts S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Ellen," meaning Sam only gave apples to Ellen and no one else. S2 states that Sam didn’t give apples to Tom, which is entailed by S1 since Tom is not Ellen.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Rob" and the item given is "bananas," meaning Sam didn’t give Rob anything else except bananas. S2 talks about giving oranges to Rob, which is about different items, making S2 independent of S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Bill" with "bananas," meaning Sam did not give Bill any other fruit. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Bill grapes, which aligns with the fact that the only thing Bill received was bananas.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Ellen" with "oranges," meaning Sam did not give Ellen anything other than oranges. S2 confirms that no grapes were given to Ellen, which is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Mary" with "bananas," meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else. S2 talks about Ellen not receiving bananas, which does not add or contradict the information in S1. It’s simply independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Bill" with "bananas," meaning no one else received bananas. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Tom bananas, which is directly entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "Sue" with "oranges," meaning Sue received nothing else other than oranges. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Sue grapes, which is entailed by S1.
