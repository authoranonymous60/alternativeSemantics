You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on “ROB” in S1, meaning Sam did not give anyone else grapes, and this does not exclude giving Rob other items (like apples). S2 states that Sam didn’t give Rob apples, which is compatible with S1. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on “SUE” in S1, meaning Sam did not give anyone else grapes. S2 contradicts this by stating Sam also gave Tom grapes. Therefore, S2 is contradicted by S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on “ELLEN” in S1, meaning Sam did not give anyone else grapes. S2 talks about Rob not getting grapes, which is consistent with S1 but independent since it doesn't elaborate on Ellen or introduce a direct contradiction. Thus, S2 is independent relative to S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on “MARY” in S1, meaning Sam did not give anyone else grapes. S2 states that Mary got something else (bananas), which does not contradict S1, since S1 does not place limits on what else Mary might have received beyond grapes. Therefore, S2 is independent of S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave SUE APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on “APPLES” in S1, meaning Sue didn’t receive anything else from Sam, but also Sam didn’t give apples to anyone else. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Bill apples. This is directly entailed by S1 since S1 means only Sue got apples. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam gave Bill oranges.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on “TOM” in S1, meaning Sam did not give anyone else apples. S2 talks about oranges given to Bill, not apples. This is consistent with but independent of S1 since S1 says nothing about other fruits given to others. Therefore, S2 is independent of S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on “ROB” in S1, meaning Sam did not give anyone else oranges. S2 says Sam gave Rob apples, which is about a different item, not oranges. This is not contradictory and does not follow directly from S1. Therefore, S2 is independent relative to S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue bananas.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus is on “BILL” in S1, meaning Sam did not give anyone else bananas. S2 contradicts this by stating Sam also gave Sue bananas. Therefore, S2 is contradicted by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus is on “MARY” in S1, meaning Sam did not give anyone else apples. S2 talks about giving Mary a different item—oranges—which S1 does not address. Therefore, S2 is independent of S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on “ROB” in S1, meaning Sam did not give anyone else bananas. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Bill bananas, which is consistent with and follows directly from S1. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.
