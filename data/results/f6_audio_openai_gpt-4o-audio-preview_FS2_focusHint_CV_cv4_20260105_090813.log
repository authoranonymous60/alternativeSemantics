You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.
C
Because...

9
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus is on "Rob," meaning that Sam didn't give apples to anyone else but Rob. Therefore, it is entailed that Sue did not receive apples.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because the focus is on "Sue," meaning that Sam only gave Sue grapes and nothing else. The second statement contradicts this by saying he also gave her oranges.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on "Sue," meaning that Sam only gave Sue grapes and nothing else. Therefore, it is entailed that he did not give her bananas.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
B  
Because the focus is on "Mary," meaning that Sam only gave Mary grapes. This does not entail anything about whether Sam gave grapes to others like Ellen, so the two statements are independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the focus is on "oranges," meaning that Sam only gave Rob oranges and nothing else. The second statement contradicts this by saying he also gave Rob bananas.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on "bananas," meaning that Sam only gave Sue bananas and nothing else. Therefore, it is entailed that he did not give Sue grapes.

6  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
A  
Because the focus is on "grapes," meaning that Sam only gave Tom grapes, and therefore, it is entailed that he did not give Tom any other fruit like apples.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus is on "bananas," meaning that Sam only gave Tom bananas and therefore, it is entailed that he did not give Tom grapes.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the focus is on "apples," meaning that Sam only gave apples to Rob and nothing else, so the second statement contradicts the first by saying he also gave Rob grapes.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the focus is on "grapes," meaning that Sam only gave grapes to Ellen and nothing else, so the second statement contradicts the first by saying he also gave her oranges.
