--- Attempt 1 for f10_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because S1 states that Tom only received apples, but S2 contradicts this by saying Tom also received grapes.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.  
B  
Because S1 talks about Mary and bananas, but S2 talks about Bill and bananas, so the two statements are independent.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because S1 states that Mary only got apples, but S2 contradicts that by saying Mary also got bananas.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
B  
Because S1 focuses on Sue and apples, while S2 talks about Rob and apples, making them independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because S1 says Bill only received bananas, but S2 contradicts this by adding that Bill also got grapes.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, it follows that Rob didn’t get apples, so S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
B  
Because S1 is about Sue, and S2 is about Tom, the statements don’t affect each other, so they are independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
B  
Because S1 is about Ellen, and S2 is about Rob, there’s no direct link between the two statements.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because S1 says Mary only got grapes, but S2 contradicts that by saying she also got bananas.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
B  
Because S1 talks about Sue and apples, while S2 talks about Bill and apples, making them independent.
