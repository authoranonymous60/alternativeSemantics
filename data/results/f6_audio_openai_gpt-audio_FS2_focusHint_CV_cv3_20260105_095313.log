You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

6  
S1: Sam only gave Tom GRAPES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on the item "grapes," meaning Sam didn't give Tom anything else besides grapes. Therefore, S2, which says Sam didn't give Tom apples, is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on the person "Tom," meaning Sam gave no one else bananas. It doesn't specify what else Tom might have received besides bananas, so S2 is independent of S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on the person "Rob," meaning Sam gave apples only to Rob and no one else. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam didn't give Sue apples.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on the person "Sue," meaning Sam gave grapes only to Sue and not to anyone else, but it does not say Sue received something else. S2 contradicts S1 because it asserts that Sue also received oranges, which violates the exclusivity implied by "only." 

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on the person "Sue," meaning grapes were given only to Sue and nothing else was given to Sue. Therefore, S2, which states that Sam didn't give Sue bananas, is entailed by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on the person "Mary," meaning only Mary received grapes, and no one else did. Therefore, S2, which says Sam also gave Ellen grapes, contradicts S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on the item "oranges," meaning Sam gave Rob nothing else but oranges. Therefore, S2, which says Sam also gave Rob bananas, directly contradicts S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on the item "bananas," meaning Sue received only bananas and nothing else from Sam. Therefore, S2, which says that Sam didn't give Sue grapes, is entailed by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on the person "Tom," meaning grapes were given only to Tom and no one else. It also entails that Tom didn't get anything else from Sam. Therefore, S2, which says Sam didn’t give Tom apples, is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on the person "Tom," meaning bananas were given only to Tom, and Tom didn’t get anything else from Sam. Therefore, S2, which says Sam didn’t give Tom grapes, is entailed by S1.
