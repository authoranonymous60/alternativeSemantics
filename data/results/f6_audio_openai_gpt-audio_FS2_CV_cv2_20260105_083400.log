--- Attempt 1 for f6_cv2 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
B  
Because S2 is stating something about Sue, while S1 focuses on Rob, so they are independent statements and do not directly relate to each other in an entailment or contradiction.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on Sue and the fact that only grapes were given, so S2 directly contradicts that by introducing another item (oranges) given to Sue.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Sue grapes, then it’s entailed by S1 that Sam did not give Sue bananas.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
B  
Because S1 is about Mary only receiving grapes, while S2 discusses Ellen also receiving grapes. There’s no direct entailment or contradiction between what was said about Mary and what was said about Ellen.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, then giving Rob bananas contradicts the statement.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because if the only thing Sam gave Sue was bananas, it entails that grapes were not given.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom grapes, then it logically follows that apples were not given to Tom.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Tom bananas, it entails that grapes were not given to Tom.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, then giving him grapes contradicts that statement.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen grapes, then giving her oranges contradicts the original statement.
