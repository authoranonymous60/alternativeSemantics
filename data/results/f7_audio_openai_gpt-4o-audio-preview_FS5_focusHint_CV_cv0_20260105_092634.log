--- Attempt 1 for f7_cv0 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue bananas.  
B  
Because "only gave SUE apples" means Sue only received apples, and not other fruits from Sam. S2 talks about bananas, which isn't entailed or contradicted directly by S1. So they are independent.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because "only gave ELLEN oranges" means Ellen is the only person who got oranges from Sam. S2 discusses what Tom didn't get, which is independent of the focused assertion about Ellen.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because "only gave TOM apples" entails that no one else, including Mary, received apples from Sam. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because "only gave TOM apples" means Tom was the only recipient of apples. S2 contradicts this by suggesting Sam gave apples to Bill as well.

4  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because "only gave SUE bananas" means Sue is the sole recipient of bananas, which means Tom did not get any. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue grapes.  
A  
Because "only gave BILL grapes" means Bill is the only person who got grapes. Therefore, S2 is entailed because Sue didn’t get any grapes.

6  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen oranges.  
A  
Because "only gave MARY oranges" means Mary is the only person who received oranges. Therefore, S2 is entailed since Ellen did not receive any oranges.

7  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because "only gave SUE apples" means Sue was the only person who got apples. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam gave apples to Bill as well.

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
A  
Because "only gave TOM apples" means Tom is the only person who received apples, so Bill didn’t get any. S2 is thus entailed by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because "only gave MARY bananas" means Mary was the only one to get bananas, so Tom didn’t get any. Therefore, S2 is entailed.
