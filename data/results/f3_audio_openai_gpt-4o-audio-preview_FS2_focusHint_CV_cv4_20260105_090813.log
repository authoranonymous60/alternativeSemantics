You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus on "ELLEN" in S1 means Sam only gave grapes to Ellen and no one else, so it entails that Sam didn't give grapes to Tom.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus on "ELLEN" in S1 means Sam gave apples only to Ellen. S2 directly contradicts this by saying Sam didn't give Ellen apples.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus on "ROB" in S1 means Sam gave grapes only to Rob and no one else. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave grapes to Ellen.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus on "ROB" in S1 means Sam gave apples only to Rob and no one else. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave apples to Ellen.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus on "ELLEN" in S1 means Sam only gave apples to Ellen and no one else. S2 aligns with this by saying Sam didn’t give apples to Bill, which supports the initial statement.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus on "ROB" in S1 means Sam only gave apples to Rob and no one else. S2 is entailed, as it follows that Sue didn’t receive apples from Sam.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus on "ROB" means Sam gave oranges only to Rob, it doesn’t make any statements about what else he gave to Rob. So giving Rob apples is independent of the statement.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus on "ROB" means Sam gave apples only to Rob, but it’s silent on what else Sam may have given to Rob. So giving Rob grapes is independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus on "ROB" means Sam gave bananas only to Rob and no one else, so it is entailed that Sam didn't give Ellen bananas.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus on “APPLES” means Sam gave apples only to Mary and not different fruits. S2 contradicts this by saying Sam also gave apples to Ellen.
