--- Attempt 1 for f5_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because focusing on "GRAPES" means that Sam did not give Ellen anything else besides grapes. The second sentence, which says Sam also gave Ellen oranges, contradicts this by adding another item.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because focusing on "ELLEN" means that Sam gave apples only to Ellen, not to anyone else. The second sentence, which talks about giving apples to Rob, is independent since it involves a different recipient.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because focusing on "oranges" means Sam gave Mary nothing else besides oranges. Saying Sam didn’t give her bananas is consistent with this and therefore entailed.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
B  
Because focusing on "MARY" means Sam gave oranges only to Mary. The second sentence, that Sam also gave oranges to Tom, is independent since it's about a different person, so it doesn't contradict or entail what was said about Mary.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because focusing on "MARY" means Sam gave oranges only to Mary. The second sentence, that Sam didn’t give oranges to Tom, is independent since it's talking about a different person. It doesn't contradict or entail the first statement.

5  
S1: Sam only gave Mary GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "GRAPES" means that Sam did not give Mary anything else besides grapes. The second sentence contradicts that by saying Sam gave her apples as well.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "SUE" means that Sam gave apples only to Sue and not to anyone else. The second sentence contradicts that by saying that Mary also got apples.

7  
S1: Sam only gave Bill ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because focusing on "ORANGES" means that Sam did not give Bill anything else besides oranges. The second sentence contradicts that by adding bananas as another thing he gave to Bill.

8  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because focusing on "BANANAS" means that Sam did not give Ellen anything else besides bananas. The second sentence contradicts that by adding grapes.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Tom BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because focusing on "BANANAS" means that Sam didn’t give Tom anything else besides bananas. This makes it entailed that Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.
