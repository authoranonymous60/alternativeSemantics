You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus is on "ROB" in S1, meaning Sam gave bananas only to Rob, and to no one else. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam did not give Tom (or anyone other than Rob) bananas.

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because in S1, the focus is on "TOM," which means Sam gave only grapes to Tom, but this does not specify what else Tom didn’t receive. The focus is on the recipient, not the item, so the information about oranges isn't entailed or contradicted.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "oranges,” meaning that oranges were the only thing given to Sue. If S2 says Sue also received apples, this contradicts S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam only gave bananas to Sue, and no one else. Therefore, it is entailed that Rob did not receive bananas.

4  
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the focus is on "oranges,” meaning Sam gave Tom only oranges, and nothing else. This entails that Tom did not receive bananas or anything else.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because the focus is on "apples," meaning Sue only received apples, and not oranges or anything else. Thus, the statement that Sue didn’t get oranges is entailed.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus is on "grapes," meaning Sue only got grapes and not apples or anything else. Therefore, the statement that Sue did not receive apples is entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because the focus is on "oranges," meaning that oranges were the only thing Ellen received. If S2 says Ellen also received bananas, it directly contradicts S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the focus is on "grapes," meaning grapes were the only thing Mary received. Therefore, it is entailed that Mary didn’t receive apples or anything else.

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
B  
Because the focus is on "BILL," meaning Bill is the only person who received oranges from Sam. This does not say anything about whether Mary received oranges from someone else or not, so the two statements are independent.
