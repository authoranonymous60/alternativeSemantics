--- Attempt 1 for f9_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on ELLEN, meaning Sam didn't give anyone else bananas. S2 says Sam gave Ellen an additional fruit, grapes, which contradicts the meaning of the “only” statement focused on the recipient.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on MARY, meaning Sam didn’t give anyone else apples. This doesn’t exclude that Mary didn’t receive other fruits. S2 says Mary didn’t get oranges, which aligns with S1’s implication that apples were the only thing Sam gave Mary.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on TOM, meaning Sam didn’t give anyone else bananas. S2 says Tom also got apples, contradicting the implication that bananas were the only thing given to Tom.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on MARY, meaning no one else got apples. This doesn't prevent Mary from not receiving other fruits. S2 affirms Mary didn’t get grapes, which is consistent, not contradictory.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on ORANGES, meaning Sam gave Mary nothing else but oranges. S2 confirms that Mary didn’t get apples, which aligns with S1’s meaning.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on APPLES, meaning Sam gave Rob nothing but apples. S2 involves another person (Mary) also receiving apples, but it doesn’t contradict that Rob only got apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on ROB, meaning no one else got apples. S2 says Tom also got apples, contradicting the focus in S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on ORANGES, meaning Sam didn’t give Rob anything else. S2 says Rob didn’t get bananas, which fits with the idea that oranges were the only thing Rob got.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on GRAPES, meaning Sam gave Bill nothing but grapes. However, S1 says nothing about whether others (Rob) got grapes, so S2 is independent.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on GRAPES, meaning Sam didn’t give Rob anything else. S2 says Rob also got bananas, contradicting the focus in S1.
