You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB," meaning Sam did not give anyone else bananas. Therefore, S2 is entailed since it confirms that Sam did not give Tom (or others) bananas.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave TOM grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM," meaning Sam gave grapes to Tom and nothing else. Therefore, S2 is entailed because it confirms Sam did not give Tom oranges or any other fruit.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "oranges." This means Sam gave Sue nothing else but oranges. S2 contradicts this by saying Sue also got apples.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning Sam gave no one else bananas. So, it’s entailed that Rob did not receive bananas.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "oranges," meaning Sam gave Tom only oranges and nothing else. Therefore, it is entailed that Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "apples," meaning Sue only received apples and nothing else. S2 is entailed because it confirms that Sue did not receive oranges.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "grapes," meaning Sue only got grapes and nothing else. Therefore, it’s entailed that she didn’t get apples.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen bananas.  
C  
Because the focus is on "oranges," meaning Sam only gave Ellen oranges. S2 contradicts this by saying Ellen also got bananas.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the focus is on "grapes," meaning Mary received only grapes and nothing else. S2 is entailed since it confirms that Mary didn’t receive apples.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary oranges.  
B  
Because the focus is on "oranges," meaning Sam only gave Bill oranges and no one else got oranges. S2 introduces that Mary also got oranges, but doesn't logically depend on or contradict S1; it’s independent.
