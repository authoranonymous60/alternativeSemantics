You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "TOM," meaning Sam gave apples to no one else besides Tom. S2 says Sam also gave Tom grapes, which contradicts the exclusivity implied by S1.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave Tom GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "GRAPES," meaning Sam didn’t give Tom anything else besides grapes. S2 says Sam also gave Tom apples, which contradicts the exclusive meaning from S1.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave bananas to no one other than Mary. S2, which says Sam didn’t give Bill bananas, is entailed because this follows from the exclusivity that only Mary received bananas.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave Mary APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "APPLES," meaning Sam didn’t give Mary anything besides apples. S2 claims Sam also gave Mary bananas, which directly contradicts the exclusivity in S1.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "SUE,” meaning Sam gave apples to Sue and no one else. S2 says Sam didn’t give Rob apples, which is compatible with the exclusivity expressed in S1, making S2 entailed.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
B  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "BILL," meaning no one besides Bill received bananas. However, S2 speaks about what else Bill received (grapes), which is independent of what S1 is asserting (the exclusive banana recipient).  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "GRAPES," meaning Sam didn’t give Rob anything besides grapes. S2, which says Sam didn’t give Rob apples, aligns with the exclusive meaning, and therefore is entailed.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "SUE," meaning no one other than Sue received grapes. S2 says Sam also gave Tom grapes, which contradicts the exclusivity in S1.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "ELLEN," meaning no one besides Ellen got grapes. S2 says Sam didn’t give Rob grapes, which is perfectly consistent with this exclusivity and is thus entailed.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because in S1, the prosodic focus is on "GRAPES," meaning Sam didn’t give Mary anything besides grapes. S2 says Sam also gave Mary bananas, which contradicts the exclusivity conveyed by the focus in S1.
