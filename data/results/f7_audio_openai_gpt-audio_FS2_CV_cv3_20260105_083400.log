--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on BILL getting bananas exclusively, and S2 contradicts this by stating additional items were given to Bill, not just bananas.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on BILL and grapes, and this implies that Bill did not get other things like oranges. S2 is entailed by that exclusivity.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because S1 focuses on MARY as the only recipient of apples, and S2 contradicts that by adding another recipient of apples, Ellen.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because S1 focuses on SUE as the sole recipient of apples, and S2 contradicts this exclusivity by stating that Tom also received apples.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is that Bill got grapes and nothing else (no oranges, no other items), which matches the statement in S2 about the absence of oranges.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on BILL and apples exclusively, meaning no bananas or other fruits were given to Bill. This logically entails S2.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because focusing on ELLEN for oranges means no one else, including Tom, got oranges.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because focusing on TOM for apples means no one else, including Mary, got apples.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because S1 focuses on TOM as the only recipient of apples, and S2 contradicts that by adding another recipient, Bill.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on SUE and bananas exclusively, meaning only Sue got bananas, and this entails that Tom did not.
