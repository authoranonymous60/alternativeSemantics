--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.
B
Because the focus is on Ellen in S1, and S2 introduces a comparison with Tom, which is independent information and doesn’t contradict or follow from the first statement.

1
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.
C
Because in S1, it is stated that Sam did give Ellen apples, while in S2, it states that Sam didn’t give Ellen apples. This directly contradicts the content of S1.

2
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
C
Because S1 says that Rob was the only one who received grapes, while S2 contradicts this by saying Ellen also received grapes.

3
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.
C
Because S1 states that only Rob received apples, and S2 contradicts this by saying Ellen also received apples.

4
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.
B
Because the fact that Sam didn’t give apples to Bill is independent of S1, which focuses on Ellen being the only recipient.

5
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.
B
Because S1 focuses on Rob as the only recipient of apples, and S2 provides independent information that Sue didn’t receive apples. The two statements don’t entail or contradict each other.

6
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.
B
Because S1 focuses on oranges, stating that only Rob received them, while S2 introduces independent information about apples and does not contradict or follow from S1.

7
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.
B
Because S1 focuses on apples, saying that Rob was the only one to receive them. S2 is about grapes, which is independent information and does not contradict or entail S1.

8
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.
A
Because if Rob is the only recipient of bananas (as S1 states), it follows that Ellen didn’t receive bananas. S2 is entailed by S1.

9
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.
C
Because S1 states that Mary was the only person to receive apples, while S2 contradicts this by saying Ellen also received apples.
