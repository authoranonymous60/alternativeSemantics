You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.

Understood. I'll begin processing the input audio for each of the ten examples (0 through 9), following the given structure: transcribing S1 and S2, marking prosodic focus in S1 with UPPERCASE, and classifying the relationship of S2 to S1 as A (entailed), B (independent), or C (contradicted), along with an explanation. Let’s start. 

0  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave TOM grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM"—meaning he only gave apples to Tom, not others—this does not exclude that he may have given Tom something else (like grapes). S2 is adding more detail about what Tom got, and does not contradict the "only" structure tied to the focus. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give BILL bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY"—the statement excludes other people from receiving bananas. S2 says Bill didn’t get bananas, which directly aligns with the implication of S1. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave MARY bananas.  
C  
Because the focus is on "MARY" in S1—Mary only received apples. S2 states that Mary also received bananas, which contradicts the idea that she solely received apples. Therefore, S2 is contradicted by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ROB apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE"—only Sue got apples, meaning no other person got apples. S2 confirms this by stating that Rob didn’t receive apples. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave BILL grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL"—Bill only received bananas. S2 states that Bill also received grapes, directly contradicting the claim that bananas were the only thing Bill received. Therefore, S2 is contradicted by S1.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ROB apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB"—only Rob got grapes, and this excludes Rob from having received apples or anything else. S2 states that Rob didn’t get apples, which aligns with the implication. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave TOM grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE"—only Sue got grapes. If S2 says that Tom also got grapes, this contradicts the exclusivity implied by S1. Therefore, S2 is contradicted by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give ROB grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN"—only Ellen received grapes. That means others (like Rob) did not get grapes. S2 confirms that Rob didn’t get grapes. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave MARY bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY"—Mary only got grapes. S2 says Mary also got bananas, contradicting the exclusivity of grapes in S1. Therefore, S2 is contradicted by S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give BILL apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE"—only Sue got apples, excluding others from getting apples. S2 states Bill didn’t get apples, which is consistent with this exclusivity. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.
