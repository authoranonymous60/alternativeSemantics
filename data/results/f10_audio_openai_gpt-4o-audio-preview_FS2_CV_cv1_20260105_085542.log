--- Attempt 1 for f10_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because the focus on "TOM" in S1 means the distribution is exclusive to Tom and apples. Saying he also gave Tom grapes contradicts that exclusivity.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because the focus on "MARY" means Sam gave bananas specifically and exclusively to Mary, so it follows that Bill did not receive any bananas.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
B  
Because the exclusive focus in S1 is specifically on apples, so giving Mary bananas is unrelated to that and doesn’t contradict or confirm the statement.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the focus on "SUE" means apples were exclusively given to Sue, so it is entailed that Rob did not receive any apples.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because the focus on "BILL" and "bananas" means the only thing Bill received from Sam was bananas, so giving Bill grapes contradicts that exclusivity.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the focus on "ROB" and "grapes" means Sam exclusively gave Rob grapes, so it’s entailed that Rob did not receive apples.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because the focus on "SUE" and "grapes" implies exclusivity, meaning only Sue got grapes. If Tom also got grapes, that contradicts the exclusivity.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because the focus on "ELLEN" means only Ellen got grapes, so it is entailed that Rob did not receive any grapes.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
B  
Because the focus is on the fact that grapes were exclusive to Mary, but that doesn’t exclude the possibility of Mary getting something else (like bananas), so it’s independent.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because the focus on "SUE" means apples were exclusively given to Sue, so it is entailed that Bill did not receive apples.
