You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," meaning that Sam did not give grapes to anyone else besides Ellen. S2 says that Sam gave Ellen something else (oranges), which doesn’t match that restriction. S2 contradicts the implied meaning that the only relevant action was giving Ellen grapes.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB apples.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus in S1 is on "ELLEN," which means Sam gave apples only to Ellen, not to anyone else. But S2 states that Sam also gave apples to Rob. This contradicts the idea in S1 that Ellen was the only recipient of apples.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning Sam gave oranges to Mary and not oranges to anyone else. S2 says that Sam didn’t give Mary bananas, which is consistent with the idea from S1 that the only thing Mary got was oranges and nothing else. Therefore, S2 is entailed.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave TOM oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning that Mary was the only person who received oranges. S2 says that Sam also gave oranges to Tom. This contradicts the restriction in S1 that no one else besides Mary received oranges.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give TOM oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY," meaning only Mary got oranges, and no one else got oranges. S2’s statement that Sam didn’t give Tom oranges directly aligns with this restriction. Therefore, S2 is entailed.

5  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "grapes," meaning that the only thing Sam gave to Mary was grapes and nothing else. S2 says Sam also gave Mary apples. This contradicts the idea in S1 that grapes were the only thing given to Mary.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave MARY apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE," meaning that Sue was the only person who received apples. S2 says that Sam also gave apples to Mary, so it contradicts the notion that Sue was the sole recipient of apples.

7  
S1: Sam only gave BILL oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave BILL bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "oranges," meaning oranges were the only thing Sam gave to Bill. S2 states that Sam also gave Bill bananas, which contradicts the idea that Bill received only oranges.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus is on both "ELLEN" and "BANANAS" in S1 (with primary focus here on the object "BANANAS"), meaning that the only thing Sam gave Ellen was bananas. S2 says he also gave Ellen grapes, which contradicts that restriction.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Tom BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BANANAS," meaning bananas were the only thing given to Tom. S2 says that Sam didn’t give Tom oranges, which is fully consistent with the meaning of S1. Therefore, S2 is entailed.
