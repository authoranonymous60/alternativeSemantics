--- Attempt 1 for f7_cv2 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave BILL BANANAS.
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.
C
Because S1 claims that the only thing Sam gave Bill was bananas, but S2 says Sam also gave Bill grapes, which directly contradicts the exclusivity implied by "only" in S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave MARY APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.
C
Because S1 says Mary was the only person to whom Sam gave apples. S2 contradicts that by stating that Sam also gave apples to Ellen.

2
S1: Sam only gave SUE APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.
C
Because S1 asserts that Sue was the only recipient of apples. S2 contradicts that by claiming that Tom also received apples.

3
S1: Sam only gave BILL GRAPES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill oranges.
A
Because S1 says that the only thing Sam gave Bill is grapes. That does not exclude the fact that Sam didn’t give Bill something else, like oranges. S2 is entailed by S1.

4
S1: Sam only gave BILL APPLES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.
A
Because if Sam only gave Bill apples, then by necessity, Sam did not give Bill any other fruits, including bananas. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.

5
S1: Sam only gave SUE APPLES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue bananas.
A
Because if Sam only gave Sue apples, then that excludes other fruits, including bananas. So S2 is entailed by S1.

6
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN ORANGES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.
B
Because S1 talks about what was given to Ellen, specifically that only Ellen got oranges. S2 talks about a different person, Tom, and says he didn’t get oranges. There’s no direct entailment or contradiction about Tom in S1, so S2 is independent from S1.

7
S1: Sam only gave TOM APPLES.
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.
A
Because S1 says only Tom got apples. That implies no one else, including Mary, got apples. So S2 is entailed by S1.

8
S1: Sam only gave TOM APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.
C
Because S1 states that only Tom received apples, which means no one else got apples. S2 contradicts that by asserting that Bill also got apples.

9
S1: Sam only gave SUE BANANAS.
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.
A
Because S1 states that only Sue received bananas, implying that no one else, including Tom, received bananas. This means that S2 is entailed by S1.
