--- Attempt 1 for f10_cv0 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB." This means Sam did not give anyone else grapes. S2 states that Sam didn’t give Rob apples, which doesn’t contradict or add anything beyond S1. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE." This means Sam did not give grapes to anyone but Sue. S2 says Sam also gave Tom grapes, which contradicts the focus interpretation of S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ELLEN." This means that Ellen is the only person who got grapes from Sam, so S2 is consistent with that because it confirms that Rob didn’t get grapes.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY." That means Mary is the only one who received grapes. S2 talks about bananas, which is unrelated to grapes, so it is an independent statement.

4  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE." This means only Sue received apples, and no one else (such as Bill) did. Therefore, S2 is entailed by S1. 

5  
S1: Sam only gave TOM oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "TOM." This means Tom is the only person who got oranges. S2 contradicts that by saying Sue also got oranges.

6  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "BILL." That means Bill is the only one who received bananas, so it naturally follows that Rob didn’t get any, making S2 entailed by S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue apples.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE." This means Sue is the only person who received oranges. S2 talks about apples, which is outside of the scope of oranges, so this is independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "ROB." That means only Rob received apples. S2 contradicts this by stating that Tom also received apples.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on "MARY." This means she is the only person who received bananas, so S2 is entailed since it’s consistent that Bill didn’t get any.
