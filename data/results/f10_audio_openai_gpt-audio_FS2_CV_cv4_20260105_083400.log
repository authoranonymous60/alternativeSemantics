--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Tom apples, then giving Tom grapes contradicts that “only” condition.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill bananas.  
B  
Because the statement about Mary’s bananas and the statement about Bill’s bananas refer to different people and are independent.

2  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the claim that Sam only gave Mary apples is contradicted by the statement that he also gave her bananas.

3  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give ROB apples.  
B  
Because giving apples to Sue and not giving them to Rob are separate pieces of information about different individuals and are independent.

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because the “only” statement excludes the possibility of giving something else to Bill, and giving him grapes contradicts that.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, it follows logically that he didn’t give Rob apples. That is entailed.

6  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom grapes.  
B  
Because giving Sue grapes and also giving Tom grapes are independent pieces of information about different people.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the statement about Ellen receiving grapes does not provide information about Rob. The two are independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the “only” condition is contradicted by giving Mary an additional item (bananas beyond grapes).

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Bill apples.  
A  
Because if Sue was the only one who received apples, it entails that Bill did not get apples. That is entailed.
