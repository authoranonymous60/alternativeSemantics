--- Attempt 1 for f3_cv3 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 6, 7

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus on "ELLEN" in S1 means that Ellen is the exclusive recipient of grapes. This entails that no one else, including Tom, received grapes from Sam.

1  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the first sentence states that apples were exclusively given to Ellen. The second sentence contradicts this by stating Sam didn’t give Ellen apples.

2  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the first sentence indicates that only Rob got grapes. The second sentence contradicts this by stating that Ellen also got grapes.

3  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the first sentence states that only Rob received apples. The second sentence contradicts this by saying that Ellen also received apples.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Ellen, that entails he didn’t give apples to Bill or anyone else.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave apples to Rob, this entails that he didn’t give apples to Sue or anyone else.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because focusing on "ROB" means the exclusivity applies to the recipient of oranges. It doesn’t say anything about what else Rob got, so this statement doesn’t contradict or entail the second sentence. The two statements are independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the prosodic focus on "ROB" means the exclusivity applies to the recipient of apples. It doesn’t exclude Rob from receiving something else like grapes, so the second sentence is independent.

8  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen bananas.  
A  
Because the prosodic focus shows that Rob was the exclusive recipient of bananas, meaning no one else, including Ellen, received bananas.

9  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because the first sentence states that Mary was the exclusive recipient of apples. The second sentence contradicts this by saying that Ellen also received apples.
