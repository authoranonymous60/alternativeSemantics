--- Attempt 1 for f9_cv1 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Ellen bananas, that means he gave Ellen no other fruit. The statement that he also gave her grapes contradicts this.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, it means he didn’t give her anything else. The statement that he didn’t give Mary oranges is consistent with that.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Tom bananas, it means no other fruit was given to Tom. The statement that he also gave Tom apples contradicts S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary apples, then he gave her no other fruit. The statement that he didn’t give Mary grapes is consistent with that.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary oranges, it means he didn’t give her any other fruit. The statement that he didn’t give her apples is consistent with that.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because the presence of "only" limits the gift of apples specifically to Rob, but does not prevent Sam from giving apples to other people. Therefore, giving apples to Mary is independent of the restriction that he only gave apples to Rob (in the sense that the "only" applies to what Rob received, not what others might have received too).

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob apples, then no one else should have received apples. The statement that he also gave apples to Tom contradicts this.

7  
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Rob oranges, then he didn’t give Rob any other fruit. The statement that he didn’t give Rob bananas is consistent with that.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
B  
Because the focus "only" in S1 applies to what Bill received (only grapes, and nothing else). This does not limit whether Sam could have also given grapes to someone else, like Rob. Therefore, S2 is independent of S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
C  
Because if Sam only gave Rob grapes, it means no other fruit was given to Rob. The statement that Sam also gave Rob bananas contradicts this.
