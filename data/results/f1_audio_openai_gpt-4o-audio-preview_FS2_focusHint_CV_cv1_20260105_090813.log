You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 2, 3

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on “BILL,” meaning Sam didn’t give grapes to anyone else besides Bill. If S2 says Sam also gave Sue grapes, it directly contradicts the meaning of S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave ROB oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on “SUE,” meaning Sam didn’t give oranges to anyone else besides Sue. If S2 says Sam also gave Rob oranges, it contradicts the meaning of S1.

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on “SUE,” meaning Sam gave grapes only to Sue and not to anyone else. Therefore, it’s entailed that Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
B  
Because the focus in S1 is on “TOM,” meaning Sam only gave apples to Tom, but it says nothing about grapes. S2 is independent because the kind of fruit (apples vs. grapes) is not related.

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on “ROB,” meaning Sam only gave Rob oranges and nothing else. If S2 says he also gave Rob apples, it contradicts that focus.

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on “SUE.” It means Sam only gave grapes to Sue and no one else. Therefore, it follows that Sam didn’t give grapes to Tom.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on “ELLEN,” meaning Sam didn’t give bananas to anyone else besides Ellen. If S2 says Sam also gave Mary bananas, it directly contradicts S1.

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on “ROB,” meaning Sam only gave bananas to Rob, not other items. Therefore, it’s entailed that Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on “MARY,” meaning Sam only gave bananas to Mary and not other items. If S2 says he also gave Mary apples, it contradicts S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because the focus in S1 is on “SUE,” meaning Sam only gave oranges to Sue and no one else. Therefore, it follows that Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.
