--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill grapes.  
C  
Because S1 asserts that the exclusive focus is on Bill receiving bananas, meaning Bill did not receive anything else. S2 contradicts that by saying Bill also got grapes.  

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen apples.  
C  
Because S1 asserts that Mary was the only recipient of apples, meaning no one else got apples. S2 contradicts that by saying Ellen also got apples.  

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because S1 asserts that Sue exclusively received apples, meaning nobody else did. S2 contradicts that by saying Tom also got apples.  

3  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill oranges.  
A  
Because S1 focuses on Bill receiving grapes exclusively, and it entails that Bill didn’t receive anything else, including oranges. S2 supports this by stating that Bill didn’t get oranges.  

4  
S1: Sam only gave BILL apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Bill bananas.  
A  
Because S1 asserts that Bill only received apples and nothing else, which entails that Bill didn’t get bananas. S2 confirms this by stating that Bill didn’t receive bananas.  

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Sue bananas.  
A  
Because S1 asserts that Sue was exclusively given apples, and that entails that Sue didn’t receive bananas. S2 supports this by affirming Sue didn’t receive bananas.  

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN oranges.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom oranges.  
B  
Because S1 focuses on Ellen as the exclusive recipient of oranges. It says nothing directly about others like Tom and doesn’t entail anything about him. S2 introduces new information about Tom, which is independent of S1.  

7  
S1: Sam only gave TOM apples.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Mary apples.  
A  
Because S1 asserts that only Tom received apples and no one else did. This entails that Mary didn’t receive apples. S2 confirms this by stating Mary didn’t get apples.  

8  
S1: Sam only gave Tom APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill apples.  
C  
Because S1 asserts that Tom is the exclusive recipient of apples, and S2 contradicts that by saying Bill also received apples.  

9  
S1: Sam only gave Sue BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom bananas.  
A  
Because S1 asserts that Sue is the only recipient of bananas, which entails that Tom didn’t get bananas. S2 aligns with that by stating Tom didn’t receive bananas.
