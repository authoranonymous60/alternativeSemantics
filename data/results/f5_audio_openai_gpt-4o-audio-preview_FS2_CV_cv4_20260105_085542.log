--- Attempt 1 for f5_cv4 ---

--- Prompt sent to model ---


You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.




Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 8, 9

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.

S1: Sam only gave Tom BANANAS.

0  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen oranges.  
C  
Because the focus on "grapes" in S1 means that grapes are the only thing Sam gave Ellen. S2 says Sam gave Ellen oranges, which contradicts S1.

1  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
B  
Because S1 talks about what Sam gave Ellen, while S2 talks about what Sam gave Rob. The focus is different, and there's no contradiction or entailment.

2  
S1: Sam only gave Mary ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary bananas.  
A  
Because if Sam only gave Mary oranges, it means he didn't give her anything else, including bananas. S2 is entailed by S1.

3  
S1: Sam only gave Mary ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom oranges.  
B  
Because S1 is about what Sam gave Mary, while S2 is about what Sam gave Tom. There's no direct entailment or contradiction between the two.

4  
S1: Sam only gave Mary ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
C  
Because S1 says only Mary got oranges, meaning no one else got oranges. S2 says Tom didn't get oranges, which aligns with that. Actually, this is A (entailed), not C. Since S1 excludes anyone else from getting oranges, S2 is entailed.

5  
S1: Sam only gave Mary GRAPES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because if S1 means the only thing Sam gave Mary was grapes, then S2, which says Sam also gave Mary apples, contradicts that.

6  
S1: Sam only gave Sue APPLES.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because S1 is about Sue and what she received, while S2 is about Mary. The two statements are independent.

7  
S1: Sam only gave Bill ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Bill bananas.  
C  
Because S1 says Bill only got oranges, and S2 says he also got bananas, which contradicts S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave Ellen BANANAS.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus on "bananas" in S1 means bananas were the only thing Sam gave Ellen. S2 says Sam gave Ellen grapes as well, which contradicts S1.

9  
S1: Sam only gave Tom BANANAS.  
S2: Sam didn't give Tom oranges.  
A  
Because if S1 says Tom only got bananas, it entails that Tom didn't get anything else, including oranges. Thus, S2 is entailed by S1.
