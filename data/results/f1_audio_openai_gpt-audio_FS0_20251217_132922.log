You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

Understood. I’ll now proceed with your requested task. 

0  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Sue grapes.  
C  
Because the prosodic focus on "BILL" in S1 means Sam didn’t give grapes to others (like Sue), but S2 says he gave grapes to Sue. 

1  
S1: Sam only gave SUE ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob oranges.  
C  
Because the focus in S1 is on "SUE ORANGES," meaning Sam didn’t give oranges to anyone else. S2 contradicts this by saying Rob also got oranges. 

2  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Ellen grapes.  
A  
Because the focus on "SUE" in S1 means Sam gave grapes only to Sue, which entails that Sam didn’t give grapes to Ellen or anyone else. 

3  
S1: Sam only gave TOM APPLES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because the focus on "TOM APPLES" in S1 entails that Sam gave only apples to Tom and not anything else like grapes. 

4  
S1: Sam only gave ROB ORANGES.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob apples.  
C  
Because the focus on "ROB ORANGES" in S1 means oranges were the only thing Sam gave Rob. S2 contradicts by saying Rob also got apples. 

5  
S1: Sam only gave SUE grapes.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Tom grapes.  
A  
Because focusing on "SUE" in S1 means Sue was the only recipient of grapes, so Tom didn’t get any grapes. 

6  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary bananas.  
C  
Because the focus on "ELLEN" in S1 means Ellen was the only one who got bananas, but S2 says Mary also got bananas. 

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB bananas.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because the focus on "ROB BANANAS" means bananas were the only thing Sam gave Rob, so Rob didn’t get oranges. 

8  
S1: Sam only gave MARY bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
C  
Because focusing on "MARY BANANAS" in S1 means bananas were the only thing Sam gave Mary. S2 contradicts this by saying Mary also got apples. 

9  
S1: Sam only gave SUE ORANGES.  
S2: Sam didn’t give Rob oranges.  
A  
Because the focus on "SUE ORANGES" means Sue was the only one who got oranges, so Rob didn’t get oranges.
