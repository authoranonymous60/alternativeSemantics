0
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.
B
Because S1 restricts who got bananas (only Ellen), not what Ellen got; S2 adds a new, compatible claim not entailed by S1.

1
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Mary oranges.
B
Because S1 says only Mary received apples; it does not say whether Mary got oranges.

2
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.
B
Because S1 restricts who got bananas (only Tom), not what Tom got; S2 is an additional, not entailed claim.

3
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.
S2: Sam didn't give Mary grapes.
B
Because S1 limits recipients of apples to Mary but says nothing about whether Mary got grapes.

4
S1: Sam only gave Mary ORANGES.
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.
A
Because S1 says the only thing Mary got was oranges, so she did not get apples.

5
S1: Sam only gave Rob APPLES.
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.
B
Because S1 says Rob got only apples, not that only Rob got apples; S2 is compatible and not entailed.

6
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.
C
Because S1 says only Rob received apples, so giving apples to Tom would be impossible.

7
S1: Sam only gave Rob ORANGES.
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.
A
Because S1 says Rob got only oranges, which entails he didn’t get bananas.

8
S1: Sam only gave Bill GRAPES.
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.
B
Because S1 restricts what Bill got (only grapes), not who else got grapes.

9
S1: Sam only gave Rob GRAPES.
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.
C
Because S1 says Rob got only grapes, which rules out his getting bananas.
