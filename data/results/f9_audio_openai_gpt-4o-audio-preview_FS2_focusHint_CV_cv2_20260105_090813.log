You are performing a semantic classification task.


Your task has three parts:
1. Transcribe S1 and S2 from audio.
2. Mark prosodic focus in S1 using UPPERCASE.
3. Classify S2 relative to S1:
   A = entailed
   B = independent
   C = contradicted.

IMPORTANT:
- The audio for ALL examples is ALREADY INCLUDED with this message.
- You must NOT ask for audio or wait for additional input.
- You must infer S1 and S2 ONLY from the provided audio.



---------------------------------------------------------------
FOCUS GUIDANCE
---------------------------------------------------------------
The classification depends on the focused element in S1, because of
the presence of 'only', in the following way: 'Sam only gave TOM
oranges' entails that Sam did not give anyone else oranges. On the
other hand, 'Sam only gave Tom ORANGES' entails that Sam didn't give
anything else to Tom.

You must follow this logic in determining the inference. You must
also refer to this logic in producing the explanation.


Your output must follow this structure:

<index>
S1: ...
S2: ...
A
Because <explanation>

Do not add meta-comments or tool-use descriptions.

The following numbered examples ALREADY INCLUDE a correct answer: 4, 5

IMPORTANT:
- These examples are NOT demonstrations.
- They are full task items, just like the later ones.
- The presence of an answer does NOT mean you should skip them.
- You MUST produce a complete output block for EVERY numbered example (0–9).

For each numbered example (0–9), you must:
- Transcribe S1 and S2 from the audio
- Mark the focused element in S1 using UPPERCASE
- Provide your own classification (A, B, or C)
- Provide an explanation

0  
S1: Sam only gave ELLEN bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Ellen grapes.  
C  
Because the focus on "ELLEN" in S1 means Sam gave bananas to Ellen but no one else. However, S2 introduces that Sam also gave Ellen something else (grapes), contradicting the only-statement that restricts what Ellen received.

1  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary oranges.  
A  
Because the focus on "MARY" in S1 means Mary received apples and nobody else did. Therefore, it follows that Mary did not receive oranges, which is entailed by S2.

2  
S1: Sam only gave TOM bananas.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the focus on "TOM" in S1 means that Tom is the only person who received something, specifically bananas. But S2 says Tom also got apples, which contradicts the idea that Tom only received bananas.

3  
S1: Sam only gave MARY apples.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary grapes.  
A  
Because the focus on "MARY" in S1 means Mary only received apples and nothing else. Therefore, it is entailed that Mary didn’t receive grapes, as S2 states.

4  
S1: Sam only gave MARY oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Mary apples.  
A  
Because the focus on "MARY" in S1 means Mary received only oranges. It naturally follows that she did not receive apples, which is confirmed by S2.

5  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Mary apples.  
B  
Because the focus on "ROB" in S1 means Rob is the only person who received apples. The statement in S2 about Mary receiving apples does not contradict it directly but is independent, as it involves someone else who received the same thing.

6  
S1: Sam only gave ROB apples.  
S2: Sam also gave Tom apples.  
C  
Because the focus on "ROB" in S1 means Rob is the only person who got apples. If S2 says Tom also received apples, that contradicts the exclusivity implied by "only."

7  
S1: Sam only gave ROB oranges.  
S2: Sam didn't give Rob bananas.  
A  
Because the focus on "ROB" in S1 means Rob only got oranges, which means he didn’t receive anything else, like bananas. That is exactly what S2 states, so S2 is entailed by S1.

8  
S1: Sam only gave BILL grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob grapes.  
C  
Because the focus on "BILL" in S1 means that Bill is the only person who received grapes. S2 contradicts that by saying that Rob also got grapes.

9  
S1: Sam only gave ROB grapes.  
S2: Sam also gave Rob bananas.  
B  
Because the focus on "ROB" in S1 means Rob received only grapes, but the restriction is on the recipient, not the item. S2 introduces another item (bananas), which doesn't contradict S1 directly but is independent.
